 [Juicy J:] 
Yeah 
Ya'll know what it is 
Katy Perry 
Juicy J, aha 
Let's rage 
 
 [Katy Perry:] 
I knew you were 
You were gonna come to me 
And here you are 
But you better choose carefully 
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything 
Of anything and everything 
 
Make me your Aphrodite 
Make me your one and only 
But don't make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy 
 
So you wanna play with magic? 
Boy, you should know what you're falling for 
Baby, do you dare to do this? 
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse 
 
Are you ready for, ready for 
A perfect storm, perfect storm? 
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine 
There is no going back 
 
Mark my words 
This love will make you levitate 
Like a bird 
Like a bird without a cage 
But down to earth 
If you choose to walk away, don't walk away 
 
It's in the palm of your hand now, baby 
It's a "yes" or "no", no "maybe" 
So just be sure before you give it all to me 
All to me, give it all to me 
 
So you wanna play with magic? 
Boy, you should know what you're falling for 
Baby, do you dare to do this? 
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse 
 
Are you ready for, ready for 
A perfect storm, perfect storm? 
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine (love trippin') 
There's no going back 
 
 [Juicy J:] 
Uh 
She's a beast 
I call her "Karma" (come back) 
She eats your heart out 
Like Jeffrey Dahmer (woo) 
Be careful 
Try not to lead her on 
Shorty's heart is on steroids 
'Cause her love is so strong 
 
You may fall in love 
When you meet her 
If you get the chance you better keep her 
She's sweet as pie but if you break her heart 
She'll turn cold as a freezer 
That fairy-tale ending with a knight in shining armor 
She can be my Sleeping Beauty 
I'm gon' put her in a coma 
Woo! 
 
Damn I think I love her 
Shorty so bad, I'm sprung and I don't care 
She ride me like a roller-coaster 
Turned the bedroom into a fair (a fair!) 
Her love is like a drug 
I was tryna hit it and quit it 
But lil' mama so dope 
I messed around and got addicted 
 
 [Katy Perry:] 
So you wanna play with magic?

What would I do without your smart mouth? 
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out 
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin' 
I can't pin you down 
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind? 
I'm on your magical mystery ride 
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me 
But I'll be alright 
 
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine 
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind 
 
'Cause all of me 
Loves all of you 
Love your curves and all your edges 
All your perfect imperfections 
Give your all to me 
I'll give my all to you 
You're my end and my beginnin' 
Even when I lose, I'm winnin' 
 
'Cause I give you all of me 
And you give me all of you, oh-oh 
 
How many times do I have to tell you? 
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too 
The world is beating you down, I'm around 
Through every mood 
You're my downfall, you're my muse 
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues 
I can't stop singing, it's ringing 
In my head for you 
 
My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine 
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind 
 
'Cause all of me 
Loves all of you 
Love your curves and all your edges 
All your perfect imperfections 
Give your all to me 
I'll give my all to you 
You're my end and my beginnin' 
Even when I lose, I'm winnin' 
 
'Cause I give you all of me 
And you give me all of you, oh-oh 
 
Give me all of you, oh 
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts 
Risking it all, though it's hard 
 
'Cause all of me 
Loves all of you 
Love your curves and all your edges 
All your perfect imperfections 
Give your all to me 
I'll give my all to you 
You're my end and my beginnin' 
Even when I lose, I'm winnin' 
 
'Cause I give you all of me 
And you give me all of you 
 
I give you all of me 
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

You should want a bad bitch like this (Huh?) 
Drop it low and pick it up just like this (Yeah) 
Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris 
High heels, something worth a half a ticket on my wrist (On my wrist) 
Taking all the liquor straight, never chase that (Never)

Bring the hooks in, where the bass at? 
Champagne spilling, you should taste that

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep 
Dreaming about the things that we could be 
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard 
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars 
Yeah, we'll be counting stars 
 
I see this life like a swinging vine 
Swing my heart across the line 
And in my face is flashing signs 
Seek it out and ye shall find 
 
Old but I'm not that old 
Young but I'm not that bold 
And I don't think the world is sold 
On just doing what we're told 
 
I feel something so right doing the wrong thing 
And I feel something so wrong doing the right thing 
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie 
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

I feel your love, and I feel it burn 
Down this river every turn 
Hope is our four-letter word 
Make that money, watch it burn 
 
Old, but I'm not that old 
Young, but I'm not that bold 
And I don't think the world is sold

Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

Knocked on your door with heart in my hand 
To ask you a question

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life? 
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know 
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die 
Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is 'No'

Standing at that altar 
Or we will run away 
To another galaxy, you know 
You know she's in love with me 
She will go anywhere I go 
 
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life? 
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know 
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die

Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand 
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man 
These nights never seem to go to plan 
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand? 
 
Oh, won't you stay with me? 
'Cause you're all I need 
This ain't love, it's clear to see 
But, darling, stay with me 
 
Why am I so emotional? 
No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control 
And deep down I know this never works 
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt 
 
Oh, won't you stay with me? 
'Cause you're all I need 
This ain't love, it's clear to see 
But, darling, stay with me 
 
Oh, won't you stay with me? 
'Cause you're all I need 
This ain't love, it's clear to see 
But, darling, stay with me 
 
Oh, won't you stay with me? 
'Cause you're all I need 
This ain't love, it's clear to see 
But, darling, stay with me
