There's a fire starting in my heart 
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark 
Finally I can see you crystal clear 
 [Clean version:]  Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare 
 [Explicit version:]  Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare 
See how I leave with every piece of you 
Don't underestimate the things that I will do 
 
There's a fire starting in my heart 
Reaching a fever pitch 
And it's bringing me out the dark 
 
The scars of your love remind me of us 
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all 
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless 
I can't help feeling 
We could have had it all 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) 
Rolling in the deep 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) 
And you played it, to the beat 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) 
 
Baby, I have no story to be told 
But I've heard one on you 
And I'm gonna make your head burn 
Think of me in the depths of your despair 
Make a home down there 
As mine sure won't be shared 
 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) 
The scars of your love remind me of us 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) 
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) 
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) 
I can't help feeling 
We could have had it all 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) 
Rolling in the deep 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) 
And you played it, to the beat 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) 
We could have had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
But you played it, with a beating 
 
Throw your soul through every open door (woah) 
Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah) 
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah) 
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah) 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) 
We could have had it all 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) 
We could have had it all 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) 
It all, it all, it all 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) 
 
We could have had it all 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) 
Rolling in the deep 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) 
And you played it to the beat 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) 
 
We could have had it all 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) 
Rolling in the deep 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) 
 
But you played it 
You played it 
You played it 
You played it to the beat.

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag 
Drifting through the wind 
Wanting to start again? 
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin 
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in? 
 
Do you ever feel already buried deep? 
Six feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing 
Do you know that there's still a chance for you 
'Cause there's a spark in you? 
 
You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine 
Just own the night like the 4th of July 
 
'Cause, baby, you're a firework 
Come on, show 'em what you're worth 
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah" 
As you shoot across the sky 
 
Baby, you're a firework 
Come on, let your colors burst 
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah" 
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe 
 
You don't have to feel like a wasted space 
You're original, cannot be replaced 
If you only knew what the future holds 
After a hurricane comes a rainbow 
 
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed 
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road 
Like a lightning bolt your heart will glow 
And when it's time you'll know 
 
You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine 
Just own the night like the 4th of July 
 
'Cause, baby, you're a firework 
Come on, show 'em what you're worth 
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah" 
As you shoot across the sky 
 
Baby, you're a firework 
Come on, let your colors burst 
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah" 
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe 
 
Boom, boom, boom 
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon 
It's always been inside of you, you, you 
And now it's time to let it through, -ough, -ough 
 
'Cause, baby, you're a firework 
Come on, show 'em what you're worth 
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah" 
As you shoot across the sky 
 
Baby, you're a firework 
Come on, let your colors burst 
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah" 
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe 
 
Boom, boom, boom 
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon 
Boom, boom, boom 
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon


You're so hypnotizing 
Could you be the devil? Could you be an angel? 
Your touch, magnetizing 
Feels like I am floating, leaves my body glowing 
They say, "Be afraid" 
You're not like the others, futuristic lover 
Different DNA 
They don't understand you 
 
You're from a whole 'nother world 
A different dimension 
You open my eyes 
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light 
 
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me 
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison 
Take me, ta-ta-take me 
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction 
Boy, you're an alien 
Your touch, so foreign 
It's supernatural 
Extraterrestrial 
 
You're so supersonic 
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers 
Your kiss is cosmic 
Every move is magic 
 
You're from a whole 'nother world 
A different dimension 
You open my eyes 
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light 
 
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me 
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison 
Take me, ta-ta-take me 
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction 
Boy, you're an alien 
Your touch, so foreign 
It's supernatural 
Extraterrestrial 
 
This is transcendental 
On another level 
Boy, you're my lucky star 
I wanna walk on your wavelength 
And be there when you vibrate 
For you, I'll risk it all, all 
 
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me 
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison 
Take me, ta-ta-take me 
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction 
Boy, you're an alien 
Your touch, so foreign 
It's supernatural 
Extraterrestrial 
 
Extraterrestrial 
Extraterrestrial 
Boy, you're an alien 
Your touch, so foreign 
It's supernatural 
Extraterrestrial

Should've known you was trouble 
From the first kiss 
Had your eyes wide open 
Why were they open? 
 
Gave you all I had 
And you tossed it in the trash 
You tossed it in the trash, you did 
To give me all your love is all I ever asked 
'Cause what you don't understand is... 
 
I'd catch a grenade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
Throw my hand on a blade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
I'd jump in front of a train for you (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
You know I'd do anything for you (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
Oh, I would go through all this pain 
Take a bullet straight through my brain 
Yes, I would die for you, baby 
But you won't do the same 
 
No, no, no, no 
 
Black, black, black and blue 
Beat me 'til I'm numb 
Tell the devil I said "Hey" when you get back to where you're from 
Mad woman, bad woman 
That's just what you are 
Yeah, you'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car 
 
Gave you all I had 
And you tossed it in the trash

Honey got me runnin' like I'm Flo Jo 
Signs her name on my heart with an "XO" 
Love so sweet, got me vexed though 
I wanna wish it right back like Presto, yes 
Meantime, I wait for the next time 
She come around for a toast to the best time 
We LOL back and forth on the text line 
She got me fishin' for her love, I confess I'm 
Something 'bout her smile and the convo 
Got me high and I ain't comin' down, yo 
My heart's pumpin' out louder than electro 
She got me feelin' like Mr. Roboto

This is mega switch-up 
Switch-up, switch-up 
I just can't switch-up 
 
 [Apl.de.ap (will.I.am):] 
Locked, sunk in your bedrock 
Heart, pumpin' your love-shot 
Knocked out by your cold-shot 
I'm, stuck in your headlock (Switch up) 
Can't stop, won't quit 
Makin' me fiend, give it to me 
I want it all, you know what I mean 
Your love is a dose of ecstasy (Switch up) 
Addicted, I can't get away from you 
Afflicted, I need it, I miss it (Switch up) 
I want your lovin' right next to me 
And I can't erase you out of my memory 
 
 [Will.I.am:] 
I just can't switch-up
