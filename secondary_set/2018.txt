I found a love for me 
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead 
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet 
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me 
 
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love 
Not knowing what it was 
I will not give you up this time 
But darling, just kiss me slow 
Your heart is all I own 
And in your eyes you're holding mine 
 
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark 
With you between my arms 
Barefoot on the grass 
Listening to our favourite song 
When you said you looked a mess 
I whispered underneath my breath 
But you heard it, 
Darling, you look perfect tonight 
 
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know 
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home 
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets 
To carry love, to carry children of our own 
 
We are still kids but we're so in love 
Fighting against all odds 
I know we'll be alright this time 
Darling, just hold my hand 
Be my girl, I'll be your man 
I see my future in your eyes 
 
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark 
With you between my arms 
Barefoot on the grass 
Listening to our favourite song 
When I saw you in that dress 
Looking so beautiful 
I don't deserve this 
Darling, you look perfect tonight 
 
No, no, no 
 
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark 
With you between my arms 
Barefoot on the grass 
Listening to our favourite song 
I have faith in what I see 
Now I know I have met an angel in person 
And she looks perfect 
I don't deserve this 
You look perfect tonight

Take a seat 
Right over there, sat on the stairs 
Stay or leave 
The cabinets are bare and I'm unaware 
Of just how we got into this mess 
Got so aggressive 
I know we meant all good intentions 
 
So pull me closer 
Why don't you pull me close 
Why don't you come on over 
I can't just let you go 
 
Oh baby 
Why don't you just meet me in the middle 
I'm losing my mind just a little 
So why don't you just meet me in the middle 
In the middle 
Baby 
Why don't you just meet me in the middle 
I'm losing my mind just a little 
So why don't you just meet me in the middle 
In the middle 
 
Take a step 
Back for a minute, into the kitchen 
Floors are wet 
And taps are still running, dishes are broken 
How did we get into this mess 
Got so aggressive 
I know we meant all good intentions 
 
So pull me closer 
Why don't you pull me close 
Why don't you come on over 
I can't just let you go 
 
Oh baby 
Why don't you just meet me in the middle 
I'm losing my mind just a little 
So why don't you just meet me in the middle 
In the middle 
 
Looking at you I can't lie 
Just pouring out admission 
Regardless my objection 
And it's not about my pride 
I need you on my skin just 
Come over, pull me in just 
 
Oh baby 
Why don't you just meet me in the middle 
I'm losing my mind just a little 
So why don't you just meet me in the middle 
In the middle, no no 
 
Baby 
Why don't you just meet me in the middle, oh yeah 
I'm losing my mind just a little 
So why don't you just meet me in the middle, oh 
In the middle 
Baby 
Why don't you just meet me in the middle, baby 
I'm losing my mind just a little 
So why don't you just meet me in the middle, middle
