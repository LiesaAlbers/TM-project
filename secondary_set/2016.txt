For all the times that you rained on my parade 
And all the clubs you get in using my name 
You think you broke my heart, oh, girl for goodness' sake 
You think I'm cryin' on my own. Well, I ain't 
 
And I didn't wanna write a song 
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care. I don't 
But you still hit my phone up 
And, baby, I'll be movin' on 
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back 
Maybe you should know that 
 
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone 
And I never like to admit that I was wrong 
And I've been so caught up in my job 
Didn't see what's going on 
But now I know 
I'm better sleeping on my own 
 
'Cause if you like the way you look that much 
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself 
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' 
You should go and love yourself 
 
But when you told me that you hated my friends 
The only problem was with you and not them 
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong 
And tried to make me forget where I came from 
 
And I didn't wanna write a song 
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care. I don't 
But you still hit my phone up 
And, baby, I'll be movin' on 
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back 
Maybe you should know that 
 
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone 
And I never like to admit that I was wrong 
And I've been so caught up in my job 
Didn't see what's going on 
But now I know 
I'm better sleeping on my own 
 
'Cause if you like the way you look that much 
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself 
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' 
You should go and love yourself 
 
For all the times that you made me feel small 
I fell in love. Now I feel nothin' at all 
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable 
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls? 
 
'Cause if you like the way you look that much 
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself 
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' 
You should go and love yourself 
 
'Cause if you like the way you look that much 
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself 
And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm) still holdin' on (holdin' on) to somethin' 
You should go and love yourself


Baby, I like your style 
 
Grips on your waist 
Front way, back way 
You know that I don't play 
Streets not safe 
But I never run away 
Even when I'm away 
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT 
I pray to make it back in one piece 
I pray, I pray 
 
That's why I need a one dance 
Got a Hennessy in my hand 
One more time 'fore I go 
Higher powers taking a hold on me 
I need a one dance 
Got a Hennessy in my hand 
One more time 'fore I go 
Higher powers taking a hold on me 
 
Baby, I like your style 
 
Strength and guidance 
All that I'm wishing for my friends 
Nobody makes it from my ends 
I had to bust up the silence 
You know you gotta stick by me 
Soon as you see the text, reply me 
I don't wanna spend time fighting 
We've got no time 
 
And that's why I need a one dance 
Got a Hennessy in my hand 
One more time 'fore I go 
Higher powers taking a hold on me 
I need a one dance 
Got a Hennessy in my hand 
One more time 'fore I go 
Higher powers taking a hold on me 
 
Got a pretty girl and she love me long time 
Wine it, wine it, very long time 
Oh yeah, very long time 
Back up, back up, back up and wine it 
Back up, back up and wine it, girl 
Back up, back up, back up and wine it 
Oh yeah, very long time 
Back up, back up and wine it, girl 
 
Tell me, I need to know, where do you wanna go? 
'Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow 
Make you lose control 
Where, where, where 
Where, where, where, where 
Oh yeah, very long time 
Where, where, where 
Back up, back up and wine it, girl 
Where, where, where, where 
'Cause if you're down 
Back up, back up and 
'Cause if you're down 
Back up, back up and 
'Cause if you're down 
Back up, back up and 
 
I need a one dance 
Got a Hennessy in my hand 
One more time 'fore I go 
Higher powers taking a hold on me 
I need a one dance 
Got a Hennessy in my hand 
One more time 'fore I go 
Higher powers taking a hold on me

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard 
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words 
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new 
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang 
 
I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink 
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think 
 
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think 
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think 
 
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days 
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out (oh) 
Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh) 
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out 
 
We're stressed out 
 
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young 
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from 
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it 
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one 
 
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose 
Same clothes homegrown a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam 
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered 
Out of student loans and tree-house homes we all would take the latter 
 
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think 
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think 
 
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days 
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out (oh) 
Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh) 
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out 
 
We used to play pretend, give each other different names 
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away 
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face 
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money." 
Yeah 
 
We used to play pretend, give each other different names 
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away 
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face 
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money." 
Yeah

When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out (oh) 
Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh) 
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out 
 
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money 
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money 
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money 
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money 
We used to play pretend, give each other different names 
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away 
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face 
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money." 
Yeah

Hello, it's me 
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet 
To go over everything 
They say that time's supposed to heal ya 
But I ain't done much healing 
Hello, can you hear me? 
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be 
When we were younger and free 
I've forgotten how it felt 
Before the world fell at our feet 
 
There's such a difference between us 
And a million miles 
 
Hello from the other side 
I must have called a thousand times 
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done 
But when I call you never seem to be home 
Hello from the outside 
At least I can say that I've tried 
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart 
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart 
Anymore 
 
Hello, how are you? 
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry 
I hope that you're well 
Did you ever make it out of that town 
Where nothing ever happened? 
 
It's no secret that the both of us 
Are running out of time 
 
So hello from the other side (other side) 
I must have called a thousand times (thousand times) 
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done 
But when I call you never seem to be home 
Hello from the outside (outside) 
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried) 
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart 
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart 
Anymore 
 
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) 
Anymore 
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) 
Anymore 
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) 
Anymore 
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) 
Anymore 
 
Hello from the other side (other side) 
I must have called a thousand times (thousand times) 
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done 
But when I call you never seem to be home 
Hello from the outside (outside) 
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried) 
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart 
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart 
Anymore

I got this feeling inside my bones 
It goes electric, wavy when I turn it on 
All through my city, all through my home 
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we're in our zone 
 
I got that sunshine in my pocket 
Got that good soul in my feet 
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops 
I can't take my eyes up off it 
Moving so phenomenally 
Room on lock the way we rock it 
So don't stop 
 
And under the lights when everything goes 
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close 
When we move, well, you already know 
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine 
 
Nothing I can see but you 
When you dance, dance, dance 
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you 
So just dance, dance, dance 
Come on 
All those things I shouldn't do 
But you dance, dance, dance 
And ain't nobody leaving soon 
So keep dancing 
 
I can't stop the feeling 
So just dance, dance, dance 
I can't stop the feeling 
So just dance, dance, dance 
Come on 
 
Ooh, it's something magical 
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on 
Don't need no reason, don't need control 
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone 
 
'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket 
Got that good soul in my feet 
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops 
I can't take my eyes up off it 
Moving so phenomenally 
Room on lock the way we rock it 
So don't stop 
 
And under the lights when everything goes 
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close 
When we move, well, you already know 
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine 
 
Nothing I can see but you 
When you dance, dance, dance 
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you

Can't stop the feeling 
Got this feeling in my body

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you 
I drink too much and that's an issue 
But I'm OK 
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them 
But I hope I never see them 
Again 
 
I know it breaks your heart 
Moved to the city in a broke-down car 
And four years, no calls 
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar 
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop 
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop 
 
So, baby, pull me closer 
In the back seat of your Rover 
That I know you can't afford 
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder 
Pull the sheets right off the corner 
Of that mattress that you stole 
From your roommate back in Boulder 
We ain't ever getting older 
 
We ain't ever getting older 
We ain't ever getting older 
 
You look as good as the day I met you 
I forget just why I left you, 
I was insane 
Stay and play that Blink-182 song 
That we beat to death in Tucson 
OK 
 
I know it breaks your heart 
Moved to the city in a broke-down car 
And four years, no call 
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar 
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop 
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop 
 
So, baby, pull me closer 
In the back seat of your Rover 
That I know you can't afford 
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder 
Pull the sheets right off the corner 
Of that mattress that you stole 
From your roommate back in Boulder 
We ain't ever getting older 
 
We ain't ever getting older 
We ain't ever getting older 
 
So, baby, pull me closer 
In the back seat of your Rover 
That I know you can't afford 
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder 
Pull the sheets right off the corner 
Of that mattress that you stole 
From your roommate back in Boulder 
We ain't ever getting older 
 
We ain't ever getting older 
No, we ain't ever getting older 
We ain't ever getting older 
No, we ain't ever getting older 
We ain't ever getting older 
We ain't ever getting older 
We ain't ever getting older 
No, we ain't ever getting older 
 
We ain't ever getting older 
No, we ain't ever getting older
