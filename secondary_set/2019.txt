Found you when your heart was broke 
I filled your cup until it overflowed 
Took it so far to keep you close (keep you close) 
I was afraid to leave you on your own 
 
I said I'd catch you if you fall (fall) 
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all) 
And then I got you off your knees 
Put you right back on your feet 
Just so you could take advantage of me 
 
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there? 
Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me 
You know I'm the one who put you up there 
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely? 
Thinking you could live without me

I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah) 
 
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (hundred tries) 
Just running from the demons in your mind 
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (mine) 
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind 
 
Said I'd catch you if you fall (fall) 
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all)

White shirt now red, my bloody nose 
Sleeping, you're on your tippy toes 
Creeping around like no one knows 
Think you're so criminal 
 
Bruises on both my knees for you 
Don't say thank you or please, I do

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking 
I want you to be happier 
I want you to be happier 
 
When the morning comes 
When we see what we've become 
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind 
Not the fire that we've begun 
Every argument, every word we can't take back 
'Cause with all that has happened 
I think that we both know the way that the story ends 
 
Then only for a minute 
I want to change my mind 
'Cause this just don't feel right to me 
I wanna raise your spirits 
I want to see you smile but 
Know that means I'll have to leave 
 
Know that means I'll have to leave 
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking 
I want you to be happier 
I want you to be happier 
 
When the evening falls 
And I'm left there with my thoughts 
And the image of you being with someone else 
Well, it's eating me up inside 
 
But we ran our course, we pretended we're OK 
Now if we jump together at least we can swing 
Far away from the wreck we made 
 
Then only for a minute 
I want to change my mind 
'Cause this just don't feel right to me 
I wanna raise your spirits 
I want to see you smile but 
Know that means I'll have to leave 
 
Know that means I'll have to leave 
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking 
I want you to be happier 
I want you to be happier 
 
So I'll go, I'll go 
I will go, go, go 
So I'll go, I'll go 
I will go, go, go 
 
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking 
I want you to be happier 
I want you to be happier 
Even though I might not like this 
I think that you'll be happier 
I want you to be happier 
 
Then only for a minute 
I want to change my mind 
'Cause this just don't feel right to me 
I wanna raise your spirits 
I want to see you smile but 
Know that means I'll have to leave 
 
Know that means I'll have to leave 
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking 
I want you to be happier 
I want you to be happier 
 
So I'll go, I'll go 
I will go, go, go

Yeah 
Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles 
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble 
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines 
Buy myself all of my favorite things 
 
Yeah 
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch 
Who would have thought it'd turn me to a savage? 
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings 
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah) 
 
My wrist, stop watchin' 
My neck is flossy

Wearin' a ring but ain't gon' be no "Mrs." 
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches 
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches 
Think retail therapy my new addiction 
 
Whoever said money can't solve your problems 
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em 
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em" 
Happiness is the same price as "red-bottoms" 
 
My smile is beamin' (yeah) 
My skin is gleamin' (is gleamin') 
The way it shine 
I know you've seen it 
You've seen it

Oh, yeah 
I see it, I like it

Yep 
 
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers 
If it ain't money, then wrong number 
Black Card is my business card 
The way it be settin' the tone for me 
 
I don't mean to brag 
But I be like, "Put it in the bag" 
Yeah 
When you see them racks 
They stacked up like my ass 
Yeah 
 
Shoot 
Go from the store to the booth 
Make it all back in one loop 
Gimme the loot 
Never mind, I got the juice 
Nothin' but net when we shoot 
 
Look at my neck 
Look at my jet 
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect 
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set 
If I like it then that's what I get 
Yeah 
 
I want it, I got it 
I want it, I got it 
(Oh yeah) 
Yeah 
I want it, I got it 
I want it, I got it 
Oh, yeah, yeah 
 
You like my hair? 
Gee, thanks! Just bought it 
I see it, I like it 
I want it, I got it 
(I see, yep)
