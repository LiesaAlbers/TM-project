The club isn't the best place to find a lover 
So the bar is where I go (mmmm) 
Me and my friends at the table doing shots 
Drinking fast and then we talk slow (mmmm) 
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me 
And trust me I'll give it a chance now (mmmm) 
Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox 
And then we start to dance 
And now I'm singing like 
 
Girl, you know I want your love 
Your love was handmade for somebody like me 
Come on now, follow my lead 
I may be crazy, don't mind me 
Say, boy, let's not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me 
Come on now, follow my lead 
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm) 
 
I'm in love with the shape of you 
We push and pull like a magnet do 
Although my heart is falling too 
I'm in love with your body 
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bedsheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new 
I'm in love with your body 
 
Oh I oh I oh I oh I 
I'm in love with your body 
Oh I oh I oh I oh I 
I'm in love with your body 
Oh I oh I oh I oh I 
I'm in love with your body 
Every day discovering something brand new 
I'm in love with the shape of you 
 
One week in we let the story begin 
We're going out on our first date (mmmm) 
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat 
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (mmmm) 
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour 
And how your family is doing okay (mmmm) 
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat 
Tell the driver make the radio play 
And I'm singing like 
 
Girl, you know I want your love 
Your love was handmade for somebody like me 
Come on now, follow my lead 
I may be crazy, don't mind me 
Say, boy, let's not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me 
Come on now, follow my lead 
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm) 
 
I'm in love with the shape of you 
We push and pull like a magnet do 
Although my heart is falling too 
I'm in love with your body 
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bedsheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new 
I'm in love with your body 
 
Oh I oh I oh I oh I 
I'm in love with your body 
Oh I oh I oh I oh I 
I'm in love with your body 
Oh I oh I oh I oh I 
I'm in love with your body 
Every day discovering something brand new 
I'm in love with the shape of you 
 
Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on 
Come on, be my baby, come on 
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with your body 
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bedsheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new 
I'm in love with your body 
 
Come on, be my baby, come on 
Come on, be my baby, come on 
I'm in love with your body 
Come on, be my baby, come on 
Come on, be my baby, come on 
I'm in love with your body 
Come on, be my baby, come on 
Come on, be my baby, come on 
I'm in love with your body 
Every day discovering something brand new 
I'm in love with the shape of you


[Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee:] 
Â¡Ay! 
Â¡Fonsi! 
Â¡D.Y.! 
 
Ohhh 
Oh, no, oh, no 
Oh 
Hey, yeah! 
 
Diridiri dirididi Daddy 
 
Go! 
 
 [Luis Fonsi:] 
Si, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirÃ¡ndote 
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy 
 [Daddy Yankee:] 
(Â¡D.Y.!) 
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamÃ¡ndome 
MuÃ©strame el camino que yo voy, oh 
 
 [Luis Fonsi:] 
TÃº, tÃº eres el imÃ¡n y yo soy el metal 
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan 
SÃ³lo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso 
 
 [Daddy Yankee:] 
(Oh, yeah) 
Ya, ya me estÃ¡ gustando mÃ¡s de lo normal 
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo mÃ¡s 
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningÃºn apuro 
 
 [Luis Fonsi:] 
Des-pa-cito 
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito 
Deja que te diga cosas al oÃ­do 
Para que te acuerdes si no estÃ¡s conmigo 
Des-pa-cito 
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito 
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto 
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito 
 
 [Daddy Yankee:] 
Sube, sube, sube 
Sube, sube 
 
 [Luis Fonsi (Daddy Yankee):] 
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo 
Quiero ser tu ritmo 
Que le enseÃ±es a mi boca 
Tus lugares favoritos 
(Favorito, favorito, baby) 
DÃ©jame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro 
Hasta provocar tus gritos 
Y que olvides tu apellido 
 
 [Daddy Yankee:] 
Si te pido un beso ven dÃ¡melo 
Yo sÃ© que estÃ¡s pensÃ¡ndolo 
Llevo tiempo intentÃ¡ndolo 
Mami, esto es dando y dÃ¡ndolo 
Sabes que tu corazÃ³n conmigo te hace bang-bang 
Sabes que esa beba estÃ¡ buscando de mi bang-bang 
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cÃ³mo te sabe 
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuÃ¡nto amor a ti te cabe 
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje 
Empecemos lento, despuÃ©s salvaje 
 
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito 
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito 
Cuando tÃº me besas con esa destreza 
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza 
 
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito 
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito 
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas 
Pero pa' montarlo aquÃ­ tengo la pieza 
Â¡Oye! 
 
 [Luis Fonsi:] 
Des-pa-cito 
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito 
Deja que te diga cosas al oÃ­do 
Para que te acuerdes si no estÃ¡s conmigo 
Des-pa-cito 
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito 
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto 
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito

DÃ©jame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro

Y que olvides tu apellido 
 
 [Luis Fonsi:] 
Des-pa-cito 
Vamo' a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico 
Hasta que las olas griten "Â¡Ay, Bendito!" 
Para que mi sello se quede contigo 
Â¡Bailalo! 
 
 [Daddy Yankee:] 
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito 
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito 
 [Luis Fonsi:] 
Que le enseÃ±es a mi boca 
Tus lugares favoritos 
 [Daddy Yankee:] 
Favorito, favorito, baby 
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito 
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito 
 [Luis Fonsi (Daddy Yankee):]

Pull up on your block, then break it down we playing Tetris

Piss out your per diem you just gotta hate 'em, funk 
If I quit your BM I still ride Mercedes, funk

I've been reading books of old 
The legends and the myths 
Achilles and his gold 
Hercules and his gifts 
Spiderman's control 
And Batman with his fists 
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list 
 
But she said, "Where'd you wanna go? 
How much you wanna risk? 
I'm not looking for somebody 
With some superhuman gifts 
Some superhero 
Some fairytale bliss 
Just something I can turn to 
Somebody I can kiss 
I want something just like this" 
 
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo 
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo 
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo 
Oh, I want something just like this 
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo 
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo 
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo 
 
Oh, I want something just like this 
I want something just like this 
 
I've been reading books of old 
The legends and the myths 
The testaments they told 
The moon and its eclipse 
And Superman unrolls 
A suit before he lifts 
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits 
 
She said, "Where'd you wanna go? 
How much you wanna risk? 
I'm not looking for somebody 
With some superhuman gifts 
Some superhero 
Some fairytale bliss 
Just something I can turn to 
Somebody I can miss 
I want something just like this 
I want something just like this" 
 
Oh, I want something just like this 
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo 
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo 
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo 
Oh, I want something just like this 
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo 
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo 
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo 
 
Where'd you wanna go? 
How much you wanna risk? 
I'm not looking for somebody 
With some superhuman gifts 
Some superhero 
Some fairytale bliss 
Just something I can turn to 
Somebody I can kiss 
I want something just like this 
 
Oh, I want something just like this 
Oh, I want something just like this 
Oh, I want something just like this

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you 
I drink too much and that's an issue 
But I'm OK 
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them 
But I hope I never see them 
Again 
 
I know it breaks your heart 
Moved to the city in a broke-down car 
And four years, no calls 
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar 
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop 
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop 
 
So, baby, pull me closer 
In the back seat of your Rover 
That I know you can't afford 
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder 
Pull the sheets right off the corner 
Of that mattress that you stole 
From your roommate back in Boulder 
We ain't ever getting older 
 
We ain't ever getting older 
We ain't ever getting older 
 
You look as good as the day I met you 
I forget just why I left you, 
I was insane 
Stay and play that Blink-182 song 
That we beat to death in Tucson 
OK 
 
I know it breaks your heart 
Moved to the city in a broke-down car 
And four years, no call 
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar 
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop 
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop 
 
So, baby, pull me closer

Got a girl from the Southside, got braids in her hair 
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair 
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks 
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats 
 
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed 
I know every curve like the back of my hand 
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry 
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can 
 
The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt 
But I can turn 'em inside out, I don't need no help 
Got a hips like honey, so thick and so sweet 
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets 
 
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed 
I know every curve like the back of my hand 
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry 
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can 
 
We're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds 
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers 
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile 
Get there when we get there, every inch is a mile 
 
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed 
I know every curve like the back of my hand 
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry 
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can 
 
I'ma take it slow 
Just as fast as I can 
(Body like a back road) 
(Drivin' with my eyes closed) 
Got braids in her hair 
(I know every curve like the back of my hand)


First things first 
I'ma say all the words inside my head 
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh 
The way that things have been, oh ooh 
 
Second things second 
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be 
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh 
The master of my sea, oh ooh 
 
I was broken from a young age 
Taking my sulking to the masses 
Writing my poems for the few 
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me 
Singing from heartache from the pain 
Taking my message from the veins 
Speaking my lesson from the brain 
Seeing the beauty through the... 
 
Pain! 
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer 
Pain! 
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer 
Pain! 
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain 
My life, my love, my drive, it came from... 
Pain! 
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer 
 
Third things third 
Send a prayer to the ones up above 
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh 
Your spirit up above, oh ooh 
 
I was choking in the crowd 
Building my rain up in the cloud 
Falling like ashes to the ground 
Hoping my feelings, they would drown 
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing 
Inhibited, limited 
Till it broke open and rained down 
It rained down, like... 
 
Pain! 
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer 
Pain! 
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer 
Pain! 
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain 
My life, my love, my drive, it came from... 
Pain! 
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer 
 
Last things last 
By the grace of the fire and the flames 
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh 
The blood in my veins, oh ooh 
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing 
Inhibited, limited 
Till it broke open and rained down 
It rained down, like... 
 
Pain! 
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer 
Pain! 
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer 
Pain! 
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain 
My life, my love, my drive, it came from... 
Pain! 
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
