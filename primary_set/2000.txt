I can feel the magic floating in the air 
Being with you gets me that way 
I watch the sunlight dance across your face and I've 
Never been this swept away 
 
All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze 
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms 
The whole world just fades away 
The only thing I hear 
Is the beating of your heart 
 
And I can feel you breathe, it's washing over me 
And suddenly, I'm melting into you 
There's nothing left to prove 
Baby, all we need is just to be 
Caught up in the touch, slow and steady rush 
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be? 
I can feel you breathe 
Just breathe 
 
In a way, I know my heart is waking up 
As all the walls come tumbling down 
I'm closer than I've ever felt before 
And I know, and you know 
There's no need for words right now 
 
And I can feel you breathe, it's washing over me 
And suddenly, I'm melting into you 
There's nothing left to prove 
Baby, all we need is just to be 
Caught up in the touch, slow and steady rush 
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be? 
I can feel you breathe 
Just breathe 
 
Caught up in the touch 
The slow and steady rush 
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be? 
I can feel you breathe 
Just breathe 
 
I can feel the magic floating in the air 
Being with you gets me that way


Man, it's a hot one 
Like seven inches from the midday sun 
Well, I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone 
But you stay so cool 
 
My muÃ±equita, 
My Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa 
You're my reason for reason 
The step in my groove, yeah. 
 
And if you said, "This life ain't good enough." 
I would give my world to lift you up 
I could change my life to better suit your mood 
Because you're so smooth 
 
And it's just like the ocean under the moon 
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you 
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth, yeah. 
Gimme your heart, make it real 
Or else forget about it 
 
Well, I'll tell you one thing 
If you would leave it'd be a crying shame 
In every breath and every word 
I hear your name calling me out 
 
Well I'm from the barrio, 
You hear my rhythm on your radio 
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow 
Turning you 'round and 'round 
 
And if you said, "This life ain't good enough." 
I would give my world to lift you up 
I could change my life to better suit your mood 
Because you're so smooth 
 
And it's just like the ocean under the moon 
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you 
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth, yeah. 
Gimme your heart, make it real 
Or else forget about it 
 
And it's just like the ocean under the moon 
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you 
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth, yeah. 
Gimme your heart, make it real 
Or else forget about it 
 
Or else forget about it 
Or else forget about it 
Oh, let's don't forget about it 
(Gimme your heart, make it real) 
Let's don't forget about it 
Let's don't forget about it 
Let's don't forget about it 
Let's don't forget about it 
Let's don't forget about it


Ladies and gents, turn up your sound systems to the sound of Carlos Santana and the G&B, it's The Product of get-away blues from the refugee camp

Pick pocking on the corner 
See as the rich is getting richer 
The poor is getting poorer

Signed by the judge, said, "See you later."

Somewhere there's speaking 
It's already coming in 
Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind 
You never could get it 
Unless you were fed it 
Now you're here and you don't know why  
 
But under skinned knees and the skid marks 
Past the places where you used to learn 
You howl and listen 
Listen and wait for the 
Echoes of angels who won't return 
 
 [Chorus] 
He's everything you want 
He's everything you need 
He's everything inside of you 
That you wish you could be 
He says all the right things 
At exactly the right time 
But he means nothing to you 
And you don't know why  
 
You're waiting for someone 
To put you together 
You're waiting for someone to push you away 
There's always another wound to discover 
There's always something more you wish he'd say  
 
 [Chorus] 
 
But you'll just sit tight 
And watch it unwind 
It's only what you're asking for 
And you'll be just fine 
With all of your time 
It's only what you're waiting for  
 
Out of the island 
Into the highway 
Past the places where you might have turned 
You never did notice 
But you still hide away 
The anger of angels who won't return  
 
 [Chorus] 
I am everything you want 
I am everything you need 
I am everything inside of you 
That you wish you could be 
I say all the right things 
At exactly the right time 
But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why 
And I don't know why 
Why 
I don't know


Say my name, say my name 
When no one is around you 
Say baby I love you 
If you ain't runnin' game 
Say my name, say my name 
You actin' kinda shady 
Ain't callin' me "baby" 
Why the sudden change? 
 
Say my name, say my name 
When no one is around you 
Say baby I love you 
If you ain't runnin' game 
Say my name, say my name 
You actin' kinda shady 
Ain't callin' me "baby" 
Better say my name 
 
Any other day 
I would call, you would say 
"Baby, how's your day?" 
But today, it ain't the same 
Every other word is "Uh huh", "Yeah, OK" 
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady? 
 
If you took it there 
First of all let me say 
I am not the one to sit around and be played 
So prove yourself to me 
If I'm the girl that you claim 
Why don't you say the things 
That you said to me yesterday 
 
I know you say that I am assuming things 
Something's going down, that's the way it seems 
Shouldn't be no reason why you're acting strange 
If nobody's holding you back from me 
'Cause I know how you usually do 
Where you're saying everything to me times two 
Why can't you just tell the truth? 
If somebody's there, then tell me who 
 
Say my name, say my name 
When no one is around you 
Say baby I love you 
If you ain't runnin' game 
Say my name, say my name 
You actin' kinda shady 
Ain't callin' me "baby" 
Why the sudden change? 
 
Say my name, say my name 
When no one is around you 
Say baby I love you 
If you ain't runnin' game 
Say my name, say my name 
You actin' kinda shady 
Ain't callin' me "baby" 
Better say my name 
 
What is up with this? 
Tell the truth, who you with? 
How would you like it if I came over with my clique? 
Don't try to change it now 
See you gotta bounce 
When two seconds ago 
Said you just got in the house 
 
It's hard to believe that you are at home by yourself 
When I just heard the voice, heard the voice of someone else 
Just this question why do you feel you gotta lie? 
Getting caught up in your game 
When you cannot say my name 
 
I know you say that I am assuming things 
Something's going down, that's the way it seems 
Shouldn't be no reason why you're acting strange 
If nobody's holding you back from me 
'Cause I know how you usually do 
Where you're saying everything to me times two 
Why can't you just tell the truth? 
If somebody's there, then tell me who 
 
Say my name, say my name 
When no one is around you 
Say baby I love you 
If you ain't runnin' game 
Say my name, say my name 
You actin' kinda shady 
Ain't callin' me "baby" 
Why the sudden change? 
 
Say my name, say my name 
When no one is around you (If ain't nothing changed, oh) 
Say baby I love you 
If you ain't runnin' game (Baby, say my name) 
Say my name, say my name 
You actin' kinda shady 
Ain't callin' me "baby" 
Better say my name 
 
Where my ladies at 
(Yea yea yea yea yea yea) 
Can you say that, come on 
(Yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea) 
All the girls say 
(Yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea yea) 
I can't hear you 
(Yea yea yea yea) 
All my ladies say 
(Yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea yea) 
All the girls say 
(Yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea yea) 
Break it down 
(Oh woo, oh) 
What what what 
D.C., take it to the bridge 
Come on 
 
I know you say that I am assuming things 
Something's going down, that's the way it seems 
Shouldn't be no reason why you're acting strange 
If nobody's holding you back from me 
'Cause I know how you usually do 
Where you're saying everything to me times two 
Why can't you just tell the truth? 
If somebody's there, then tell me who 
 
Say my name, say my name 
When no one is around you 
Say baby I love you 
If you ain't runnin' game 
(Call me your boo) 
Say my name, say my name 
You actin' kinda shady 
(And tell me what you'd like to me, whoa) 
Ain't callin' me "baby" 
Why the sudden change? 
 
Say my name, say my name 
When no one is around you 
Say baby I love you

If you ain't runnin' game 
Say my name, say my name 
You actin' kinda shady 
Ain't callin' me "baby" 
Better say my name 
 
Thou shalt know if she can't love you


Maybe it's intuition 
But some things you just don't question 
Like in your eyes, I see my future in an instant 
And there it goes, I think I've found my best friend 
 
I know that it might sound more than a little 
Crazy, but I believe 
 
I knew I loved you before I met you 
I think I dreamed you into life 
I knew I loved you before I met you 
I have been waiting all my life 
 
There's just no rhyme or reason 
Only this sense of completion 
And in your eyes, I see the missing pieces 
I'm searching for, I think I found my way home 
 
I know that it might sound more than a little 
Crazy, but I believe 
 
I knew I loved you before I met you 
I think I dreamed you into life 
I knew I loved you before I met you 
I have been waiting all my life 
 
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
A thousand angels dance around you 
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
I am complete now that I've found you 
 
I knew I loved you before I met you 
I think I dreamed you into life 
I knew I loved you before I met you 
I have been waiting all my life 
 
I knew I loved you before I met you 
I think I dreamed you into my life 
I knew I loved you before I met you 
I have been waiting all my life 
 
I knew I loved you before I met you (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) 
I knew I loved you 
I knew I loved you before I met you (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) 
I knew I loved you 
I knew I loved you before I met you (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) 
I knew I loved you before I met you (yeah, yeah, oh) 
I knew I loved you


Every time our eyes meet 
This feeling inside me 
Is almost more than I can take 
Baby, when you touch me 
I can feel how much you love me 
And it just blows me away 
 
I've never been this close to anyone or anything 
I can hear your thoughts 
I can see your dreams 
 
I don't know how you do what you do 
I'm so in love with you 
It just keeps getting better 
I wanna spend the rest of my life 
With you by my side 
Forever and ever 
Every little thing that you do 
Baby, I'm amazed by you 
 
The smell of your skin 
The taste of your kiss 
The way you whisper in the dark 
Your hair all around me 
Baby, you surround me 
You touch every place in my heart 
 
Oh, it feels like the first time every time 
I wanna spend the whole night in your eyes 
 
I don't know how you do what you do 
I'm so in love with you 
It just keeps getting better 
I wanna spend the rest of my life 
With you by my side 
Forever and ever 
Every little thing that you do 
Baby, I'm amazed by you 
 
Every little thing that you do 
I'm so in love with you 
It just keeps getting better 
I wanna spend the rest of my life 
With you by my side 
Forever and ever 
Every little thing that you do 
Oh, yeah every little thing that you do 
Baby, I'm amazed by you


And if I fall along the way 
Pick me up and dust me off 
And if I get too tired to make it 
Be my breath so I can walk 
And if I need some other love, then 
Give me more than I can stand 
And when my smile gets old and faded 
Wait around, I'll smile again 
 
Shouldn't be so complicated 
Just hold me and then 
Oh, just hold me again 
 
Can you help me I'm bent? 
I'm so scared that I'll never 
Get put back together 
Keep breaking me in 
And this is how we will end 
With you and me bent 
 
And if I couldn't sleep, could you sleep? 
Could you paint me better off? 
And could you sympathize with my needs? 
I know you think I need a lot 
 
I started out clean but I'm jaded 
Just phoning it in 
Oh, just breaking the skin 
 
Can you help me I'm bent? 
I'm so scared that I'll never 
Get put back together 
Keep breaking me in 
And this is how we will end 
With you and me bent 
 
Start bending me 
It's never enough 'til I feel all your pieces 
Start bending me 
Keep bending me until I'm completely broken in 
 
Shouldn't be so complicated 
Just touch me and then 
Oh, just touch me again 
 
Can you help me I'm bent? 
I'm so scared that I'll never 
Get put back together 
Keep breaking me in 
And this is how we will end 
With you and me landing 
Without understanding 
Hell, I'd go there again 
Can you help me I'm bent? 
I'm so scared that I'll never 
Get put back together 
Yeah, you're breaking me in 
And this is how we will end 
With you and me bent



Darkchild 
Oh, yeah, yeah 
Toni Braxton, oh 
Ha-ha, uh-huh 
Yeah, uh, uh 
Darkchild, yeah 
 
Listen, girl 
Who do you think I am? 
Don't you know that he was my man? 
But I chose to let him go 
So why do you act like I still care about him? 
Looking at me like I'm hurt 
When I'm the one who said I didn't want it to work 
Don't you forget I had him first? 
 
What you thinkin'? 
Stop blaming me 
He wasn't man enough for me 
If you don't know now here's your chance 
I've already had your man 
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah? 
And not be worried about him 
Now it's time you know the truth 
I think he's just the man for you 
 
What are you thinking? 
Do you know about us back then? 
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend? 
I'm not thinking 'bout him 
But you married him 
Do you know I made him leave? 
Do you know he begged to stay with me? 
He wasn't man enough for me 
 
Listen, girl 
Didn't he tell you the truth? 
If not then why don't you ask him? 
Then maybe you can be more into him 
Instead of worryin' about me 
And hopefully you won't find 
All of the reasons why his love didn't count 
And why we couldn't work it out 
 
What you thinkin'? 
Stop blaming me 
He wasn't man enough for me 
If you don't know now here's your chance 
See, I've already had your man 
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah? 
And not be worried about him, yeah 
Now it's time you know the truth 
I think he's just the man for you 
 
What are you thinking? 
Do you know about us back then? 
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend?

I'm not thinking 'bout him 
But you married him 
Do you know I made him leave? 
Do you know he begged to stay with me? 
He wasn't man enough for me 
 
Oh yeah 
So many reasons why our love is through, yeah 
What makes you think he'll be good to you, no 
It makes no sense 'cause he will never change 
Girl, you better recognize the game, oh yeah 
 
What are you thinking? 
Do you know about us back then 
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend 
I'm not thinking 'bout him 
But you married him 
Do you know I made him leave?
