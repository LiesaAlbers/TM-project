I'm running and not quite sure where to go 
And I don't know what I'm diving into 
Just hanging by a moment here with you 
 
There's nothing else to lose, there's nothing else to find 
There's nothing in the world that can change my mind 
There is nothing else 
There is nothing else 
There is nothing else 
 
Desperate for changing, starving for truth 
I'm closer to where I started, I'm chasing after you

Now that she's back in the atmosphere 
With drops of Jupiter in her hair 
Hey, hey, hey 
She acts like summer and walks like rain 
Reminds me that there's a time to change 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Since the return of her stay on the moon 
She listens like spring and she talks like June 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 
But tell me, did you sail across the sun? 
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded 
And that heaven is overrated? 
 
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting starâ 
One without a permanent scar? 
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there? 
 
Now that she's back from that soul vacation 
Tracing her way through the constellation 
Hey, hey, hey (mm) 
She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo 
Reminds me that there's room to grow 
Hey, hey, hey (yeah) 
 
Now that she's back in the atmosphere 
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane 
Told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land 
 
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet? 
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day 
And head back to the Milky Way? 
 
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind? 
Was it everything you wanted to find? 
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there? 
 
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken 
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong? 
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance, five-hour phone conversation 
The best soy latte that you ever had and me? 
 
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet? 
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day 
And head back toward the Milky Way? 
 
And tell me, did you sail across the sun? 
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded 
And that heaven is overrated? 
 
And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star 
One without a permanent scar? 
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself? 
 
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na 
 
And did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day? 
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na 
And did you fall for a shooting star, fall for a shooting star? 
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na 
And now you're lonely looking for yourself out there

I think I've already lost you 
I think you're already gone 
I think I'm finally scared now 
You think I'm weak, I think you're wrong 
 
I think you're already leavin' 
Feels like your hand is on the door 
I thought this place was an empire 
Now I'm relaxed, I can't be sure 
 
And I think you're so mean, I think we should try 
I think I could need this in my life and 
I think I'm scared, I think too much 
I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealin' 
 
If you're gone 
Maybe it's time to come home 
There's an awful lot of breathin' room 
But I can hardly move 
If you're gone 
Baby, you need to come home, come home 
There's a little bit of somethin' me 
In everything in you 
 
I bet you're hard to get over 
I bet the room just won't shine 
I bet my hands I can stay here 
And I bet you need more than you mind 
 
And I think you're so mean, I think we should try 
I think I could need this in my life 
I think I'm just scared that I know too much 
I can't relate, and that's a problem I'm feelin' 
 
If you're gone 
Maybe it's time to come home 
There's an awful lot of breathin' room 
But I can hardly move 
If you're gone 
Baby, you need to come home, come home 
There's a little bit of somethin' me 
In everything in you 
 
I think you're so mean, I think we should try 
I think I could need this in my life and 
I think I'm scared, do I talk too much? 
I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealin' 
 
If you're gone 
Then maybe it's time to come home 
Well, there's an awful lot of breathin' room 
But I can hardly move 
Yeah, well, if you're gone 
Hell, baby, you need to come home, you need to come home 
There's a little bit of somethin' me 
In everything in you 
 
Somethin' me 
Everything in 
Somethin' me in 
In you



[Eve:] 
Uh, uh, uh, huh 
Yo, yo 
 
Drop your glasses, shake your asses 
Face screwed up like you having hot flashes 
Which one? Pick one, this one, classic 
Red from blonde, yeah, bitch, I'm drastic 
Why this, why that, lips stop askin' 
Listen to me, baby, relax and start passin' 
Expressway, hair back, weaving through the traffic 
This one strong, should be labeled as a hazard 
Some of y'all niggas hot, psych, I'm gassin' 
Clowns, I spot 'em and I can't stop laughin' 
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin' 
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic 
Some of y'all ain't writing well, too concerned with fashion 
None of you ain't Giselle, cat walk and imagine 
A lot of y'all Hollywood, drama, casted 
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it 
 
 [Gwen Stefani:] 
If I had to give you more, it's only been a year 
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere 
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time 
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind 
 
 [Eve:] 
They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy 
Shank up, haters wanna come after me 
You ain't a gangster, prankster, too much to eat 
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me (Huh) 
 
Now why you gritting your teeth? 
Frustration, baby, you got to breathe 
Take a lot more than you to get rid of me 
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me 
Ain't no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see 
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe 
Huh, 16's mine, create my own lines 
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find 
Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind 
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine 
Eyes bloodshot, stressing, chills up your spine 
Huh, sick to your stomach wishing I wrote your rhymes 
 
 [Gwen Stefani:] 
I knew I had to give you more, it's only been a year 
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere 
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time 
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind 
 
 [Eve:] 
Let your bones crack 
Your back pop, I can't stop 
Excitement, Glock shots from your stash spot 
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route 
Glocked down, blasters, sets while I mash out 
Yeah, nigga, mash out, D-R-E, huh 
Backtrack, make that, E-V-E 
Do you like that? (Ew) You got to I know you 
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too 
Don't believe, I'll show you, take you with me 
Turn you on, tension gone, give you relief 
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me 
Damn, she much thinner know now I'm complete (Uh-huh) 
Still stallion, brick house, pile it on 
Ryde or Die bitch, double R, came strong 
Beware, 'cause I crush anything I land on 
Me here, ain't no mistake, nigga, it was planned on 
 
 [Gwen Stefani:] 
If I had to give you more, it's only been a year 
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere 
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time 
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind


My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why 
I got out of bed at all 
The morning rain clouds up my window 
And I can't see at all 
And even if I could, it'd all be grey 
But your picture on my wall 
It reminds me that it's not so bad 
It's not so bad 
 
I drank too much last night, got bills to pay 
My head just feels in pain 
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today 
I'm late for work again 
And even if I'm there, they'll all imply 
That I might not last the day 
And then you call me 
And it's not so bad, it's not so bad 
 
And I want to thank you 
For giving me the best day of my life 
Oh, just to be with you 
Is having the best day of my life 
 
Push the door, I'm home at last 
And I'm soaking through and through 
Then you handed me a towel 
And all I see is you 
And even if my house falls down now 
I wouldn't have a clue 
Because you're near me 
 
And I want to thank you 
For giving me the best day of my life 
Oh, just to be with you 
Is having the best day of my life 
And I want to thank you 
For giving me the best day of my life 
Oh, just to be with you 
Is having the best day of my life


I've been searching for you 
I heard a cry within my soul 
I've never had a yearning quite like this before 
Now here you are, walking right through my door 
 
All of my life 
Where have you been 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
And if that day comes 
I know we could win 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
 
A sacred gift of heaven 
For better worse, wherever 
And I would never let somebody break you down 
Or take your crown, never 
 
All of my life 
Where have you been 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
And if that day comes 
I know we could win 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
 
I've searched through time, I've always known 
That you were there, upon your throne 
A lonely queen without her king 
I've longed for you, my love forever 
 
All of my life 
Where have you been 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
And if that day comes 
I know we could win 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
 
All of my life 
Where have you been 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
And if that day comes 
I know we could win 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
 
All of my life 
Where have you been 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
And if that day comes 
I know we could win 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
