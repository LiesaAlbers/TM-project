Where is the moment we needed the most 
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost 
They tell me your blue skies fade to grey 
They tell me your passion's gone away 
And I don't need no carryin' on 
 
You stand in the line just to hit a new low 
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go 
You tell me your life's been way off line 
You're falling to pieces every time 
And I don't need no carryin' on 
 
'Cause you had a bad day 
You're taking one down 
You sing a sad song just to turn it around 
You say you don't know 
You tell me don't lie 
You work on a smile and you go for a ride 
You had a bad day 
The camera don't lie 
You're coming back down and you really don't mind 
You had a bad day 
You had a bad day 
 
Well, you need a blue sky holiday 
The point is they laugh at what you say 
And I don't need no carryin' on 
 
You had a bad day 
You're taking one down 
You sing a sad song just to turn it around 
You say you don't know 
You tell me don't lie 
You work on a smile and you go for a ride 
You had a bad day 
The camera don't lie 
You're coming back down and you really don't mind 
You had a bad day 
 
(Oh, what a horrible day) 
 
Sometimes the system goes on the blink 
And the whole thing turns out wrong 
You might not make it back and you know 
That you could be well, oh, that strong 
And I'm not wrong 
 
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 
So where is the passion when you need it the most 
Oh, you and I 
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost 
 
'Cause you had a bad day 
You're taking one down 
You sing a sad song just to turn it around 
You say you don't know 
You tell me don't lie 
You work on a smile and you go for a ride 
You had a bad day 
You've seen what you like 
And how does it feel for one more time 
You had a bad day 
You had a bad day 
 
Ah, yeah yeah 
Had a bad day 
Ah, all the week 
Had a bad day 
Ah, la la la la 
Had a bad day 
Ah

Didn't think so 
 
How you doin', young lady? 
That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy 
You don't, have a player 'bout to choke 
I was at a loss for words first time that we spoke 
You're lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right? 
How you're lookin' for her in the daytime with the light? 
You might be the type if I play my cards right 
I'll find out by the end of the night 
You expect me to just let you hit it? 
But will you still respect me if you get it? 
All I can do is try, gimme one chance (Chance) 
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand (Hand) 
I'll be the first to admit it 
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent 
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it? 
Boy, I'm tired of runnin', let's walk for a minute 
 
Promiscuous girl, wherever you are

Promiscuous boy, you already know 
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for? 
Promiscuous girl, you're teasin' me 
You know what I want, and I got what you need 
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point 
'Cause we're on a roll, you ready? 
 
Roses are red, some diamonds are blue 
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kinda cute 
Hey, I can't keep my mind off you 
Where you at? Do you mind if I come through? 
I'm out of this world, come with me to my planet 
Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it? 
They call me Thomas, last name Crown 
Recognize game, I'ma lay mines down 
I'm a big girl, I can handle myself 
But if I get lonely, I'ma need your help 
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health 
I want you on my team 
So does everybody else 
Shh, baby, we can keep it on the low (Low) 
Let your guard down, ain't nobody gotta know (Know) 
If you with it, girl, I know a place we can go

Feelin' on me before you bring that on 
Bring that on?! 
You know what I mean 
Girl, I'm a freak, you shouldn't say those things 
I'm only trying to get inside of your brain 
To see if you can work me the way you say 
It's OK, it's alright 
I got something that you gon' like 
Hey, is that the truth or are you talking trash? 
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

Promiscuous boy, I'm callin' your name

Promiscuous boy, we're one and the same 
So we don't gotta play games no more


My life is brilliant 
 
My life is brilliant 
My love is pure 
I saw an angel 
Of that I'm sure 
She smiled at me on the subway 
She was with another man 
But I won't lose no sleep on that 
'Cause I've got a plan 
 
You're beautiful. You're beautiful 
You're beautiful, it's true 
I saw your face in a crowded place 
And I don't know what to do 
'Cause I'll never be with you 
 
Yes, she caught my eye 
As we walked on by 
She could see from my face that I was 
Fucking high 
 [Flying high - video/radio edited version] 
And I don't think that I'll see her again 
But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end 
 
You're beautiful. You're beautiful 
You're beautiful, it's true 
I saw your face in a crowded place 
And I don't know what to do 
'Cause I'll never be with you 
 
You're beautiful. You're beautiful 
You're beautiful, it's true 
There must be an angel with a smile on her face 
When she thought up that I should be with you 
But it's time to face the truth 
I will never be with you

I am unwritten, can't read my mind 
I'm undefined 
I'm just beginning, the pen's in my hand 
Ending unplanned 
 
Staring at the blank page before you 
Open up the dirty window 
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find 
 
Reaching for something in the distance 
So close you can almost taste it 
Release your inhibitions 
 
Feel the rain on your skin 
No one else can feel it for you 
Only you can let it in 
No one else, no one else 
Can speak the words on your lips 
Drench yourself in words unspoken 
Live your life with arms wide open 
Today is where your book begins 
 
The rest is still unwritten 
 
I break tradition, sometimes my tries 
Are outside the line 
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes 
But I can't live that way 
 
Staring at the blank page before you

So close you can almost taste it 
Release your inhibitions

No one else can feel it for you 
Only you can let it in 
No one else, no one else 
Can speak the words on your lips 
Drench yourself in words unspoken 
Live your life with arms wide open 
Today is where your book begins 
 
Feel the rain on your skin 
No one else can feel it for you 
Only you can let it in 
No one else, no one else 
Can speak the words on your lips 
Drench yourself in words unspoken

I remember when 
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind 
There was something so pleasant about that place 
Even your emotions have an echo, in so much space, mmm 
And when you're out there without care 
Yeah, I was out of touch 
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough 
I just knew too much, mm 
 
Does that make me crazy? 
Does that make me crazy? 
Does that make me crazy? 
Possibly 
 
And I hope that you are having the time of your life 
But think twice, that's my only advice, mm 
Come on now, who do you 
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are? 
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul 
You really think you're in control? 
 
Well, I think you're crazy 
I think you're crazy 
I think you're crazy 
Just like me 
 
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb 
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them, mm-hmm 
Ever since I was little 
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun 
And it's no coincidence I've come 
And I can die when I'm done 
 
But maybe I'm crazy 
Maybe you're crazy 
Maybe we're crazy 
Probably 
 
Mm-woah, ooh 
Ooh, woo-ooh 
Ooh, ooh 
Ooh-hoo, mm-hmm

Police think they can see me lean

Police see me ride by they can see the gleam 
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen 
Ride with a new chick, she like hold up 
Next to the PlayStation controller 
Is a full clip and my pistola 
Send a jacker into a coma 
Girl you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone 
Just tryna bone ain't tryna have no babies 
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies 
Law's on patrol and you know they hate me 
Music turned all the way up into the maximum 
I got speakers, some niggas tryna jack for some 
But we packing something and what we have for 'em 
We'll have a nigga locked up in a maximum security cell, 
I'm gripping oak 
Music loud and I'm tipping slow 
Twin's steady twisting like hit this dough 
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat 
Windows down gotta stop pollution 
CD changes niggas like, "Who is that producing?" 
That's the Play-N-Skillz when we out and cruising 
Got warrants in every city except Houston but I'm still ain't losing 
 
They see me rolling

Tryna catch me riding dirty

Holy shit 'cause I really can't focus 
I gotta get it home 'fore the po po's scope this 
Big old Excursion swerving 
All up in the curbing 
Nigga be sipping on the Hennessey and the gin again 
It's in again, we in the wind 
Doing a hundred while I puff on a blunt 
And roll another one up, we living like we ain't giving a fuck 
I got a blunt up in my right hand, 
40 oz in my lap freezing my balls 
Roll another tree, green leaves and all 
Coming pretty deep, me and my dogs, yo 
I gotta get the back streets 
Wondering about the six pounds and I got heat 
Glock Glock shots to the block we creep creep 
Pop Pop hope cops don't see me, on a low key 
With no regard for the law we dodge em like fuck em all 
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all 
Keep a gun in car, and a blunt to spark, 
Roll it up if you want, nigga, get it popping, dog 
Ready or not we bust shots off in the air Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire 
 
They see me rolling 
They hating

 [Chamillionaire:] 
Now would you think it so? I tried to let you go 
Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slow 
And they upset for sure, 'cause they think they know 
That they catching me with plenty of the drank and dro 
So they get behind me, tryna check my tags 
Look in my rear view and they smiling 
Thinking they'll catch me in the wrong, they keep trying 
Steady denying that it's racial profiling 
Houston, Texas, you can check my tags 
Pull me over, try to check my slab 
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash 
'Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast 
And being the baller that I am, I talk to them 
Giving a damn about them not feeling my attitude 
When they realize I ain't even riding dirty 
Bet you'll be leaving with an even madder mood 
I'mma laugh at you and then I'll have to cruise 
Yeah, my #2 on some old-school DJ Screw 
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue 
This is a message to the law, telling them, "We hate you." 
I can't be touched and tell 'em that they shoulda known 
Tipping down, I'm sitting crooked on my chrome 
Bookin' my phone, finding a chick I wanna bone 
Like they couldn't stop me I'm 'bout to pull up at your home and it's on
