Keep it down on the low-key (Low-key) 
'Cause you know how it feels (Hey!) 
I seen shorty, she was checkin' up on me 
From the game she was spitting in my ear 
You would think that she know me (Know me) 
I decided to chill (Okay!) 
Conversation got heavy (Hey!) 
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow (Watch out!) 
Oh! (Watch out) 
She's saying, "Come get me" (Come get me) 
So I got up and followed her to the floor 
She said, "Baby, let's go" 
When I told her (Let's go!), I said

Shawty got down low, she said, "come and get me" 
(Yeah!) Yeah! 
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me

(Yeah!) Yeah! 
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me, screaming 
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah! 
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah! 
 
So she's all up in my head now, got me thinking 
That it might be a good idea to take her with me 
'Cause she's ready to leave (Ready to leave now) (Let's go!) 
And I got to keep it real now 
'Cause on a one to ten, she's a certified twenty 
But that just ain't me (Hey!) 
'Cause I don't know, if I take that chance 
Just where's it gonna lead? 
But what I do know is the way she dance 
Make shorty alright with me 
The way she get low

(Hey! Hey! Luda!) 
 
 [Ludacris (Lil Jon):] 
Watch out, my outfit's ridiculous 
In the club, looking so conspicuous 
And these women all on the prowl 
If you hold the head steady, I'ma milk the cow (Yeah!) 
And forget about game, I'ma spit the truth (What?) 
I won't stop 'til I get 'em in their birthday suit (Yeah!) 
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes 
Then bend over to the front, and touch your toes 
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls 
If they ain't cutting, then I put 'em on foot patrol (Let's go!) 
How you like me now? 
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand 
Let's drink, you the one to please (Yeah!) 
Ludacris fill cups like double Ds (Yeah!) 
Me and Ursh' once more, and we leaves 'em dead 
We want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed, that say 
 
(Yeah!) Yeah! 
Shawty got down low, she said, "come and get me" 
(Yeah!) Yeah! 
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me 
(Yeah!) Yeah! 
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies 
(Yeah!) Yeah! 
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me, screaming 
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!

Girl, I understand why 
See, it's burnin' me to hold on to this 
I know this is something I gotta do 
But that don't mean I want to 
What I'm tryna say is that, I... love you, I just 
I feel like this... is comin' to an end 
And it's better for me to... let it go now 
Than hold on and hurt you 
But I gotta let it burn 
 
It's gon' burn for me to say this, but it's coming from my heart 
It's been a long time coming, but we done been fell apart 
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change 
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways 
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship 
When I'm hurtin', baby, I ain't happy, baby 
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with 
I think that you should let it burn 
 
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to 
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't 
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you (No, no) 
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn 
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you 
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else 
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through 
Let it burn (Let it burn), let it burn (Let it burn), gotta let it burn 
 
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to 
Got somebody here, but I want you 
'Cause the feelin' ain't the same 
Find myself callin' her your name 
Ladies, tell me, do you understand? 
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain? 
It's the way I feel 
I know I made a mistake, now it's too late 
I know she ain't coming back 
What I gotta do now to get my shorty back? 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo 
You've been gone for too long 
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours 
I'ma be burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn) 
 
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to 
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't 
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you 
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, you gon' learn) 
Let it burn (Gotta let it burn, oh), gotta let it burn 
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you 
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else 
But you know that it's over (Know it's over), we knew it was through 
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn 
 
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on 
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, ooh 
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on 
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, yeah 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Can you feel me burning?) 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
So many days, so many hours 
I'm still burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn) 
 
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to 
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't 
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you 
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn), let it burn, gotta let it burn 
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you 
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else 
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through 
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn) 
Let it burn, gotta let it burn


Some people live for the fortune 
Some people live just for the fame 
Some people live for the power, yeah 
Some people live just to play the game 
 
Some people think that the physical things 
Define what's within 
And I've been there before but that life's a bore 
So full of the superficial 
 
Some people want it all 
But I don't want nothing at all 
If it ain't you, baby 
If I ain't got you, baby 
Some people want diamond rings 
Some just want everything 
But everything means nothing 
If I ain't got you, yeah 
 
Some people search for a fountain 
That promises forever young (Ya know) 
Some people need three dozen roses 
And that's the only way to prove you love them 
 
Hand me the world on a silver platter 
And what good would it be? 
With no one to share 
With no one who truly cares for me 
 
Some people want it all 
But I don't want nothing at all 
If it ain't you, baby 
If I ain't got you, baby 
Some people want diamond rings 
Some just want everything 
But everything means nothing 
If I ain't got you, you, you 
Some people want it all 
But I don't want nothing at all 
If it ain't you, baby 
If I ain't got you, baby 
Some people want diamond rings 
Some just want everything 
But everything means nothing 
If I ain't got you, yeah 
 
If I ain't got you with me, baby 
Ooh, ooh 
Said nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing 
If I ain't got you with me, baby


I was so high I did not recognize 
The fire burning in her eyes 
The chaos that controlled my mind 
Whispered "Goodbye" as she got on a plane 
Never to return again 
But always in my heart, oh 
 
This love has taken its toll on me 
She said "Goodbye" too many times before 
And her heart is breaking in front of me 
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say "Goodbye" anymore 
 
Whoa, oh, oh 
Whoa, oh, oh 
Whoa, oh, oh, oh 
 
I tried my best to feed her appetite 
Keep her coming every night 
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh 
Kept playing love like it was just a game 
Pretending to feel the same 
Then turn around and leave again 
But I know 
 
This love has taken its toll on me 
She said "Goodbye" too many times before 
And her heart is breaking in front of me 
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say "Goodbye" anymore 
 
Whoa, oh, oh 
Whoa, oh, oh 
Whoa, oh, oh, oh 
 
I'll fix these broken things 
Repair your broken wings 
And make sure everything's alright 
(It's alright, it's alright) 
My pressure on your hips 
Sinking my fingertips 
Into every inch of you 
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do 
 
This love has taken its toll on me 
She said "Goodbye" too many times before 
Her heart is breaking in front of me 
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say "Goodbye" anymore 
 
This love has taken its toll on me 
She said "Goodbye" too many times before 
And my heart is breaking in front of me 
She said "Goodbye" too many times before 
 
This love has taken its toll on me 
(Oh, yeah, yeah) 
She said "Goodbye" too many times before 
(Yeah) 
And her heart is breaking in front of me 
(Yeah) 
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say "Goodbye" anymore 
 
This love has taken its toll on me


Boom, boom, boom 
Ha-ha! 
 
 [Big Boi:] 
Ready for action, nip it in the bud 
We never relaxing, OutKast is everlasting 
Not clashing, not at all 
But see, my nigga went to do a little acting 
Now, that's for anyone asking, give me one pass 'em 
Drip-drip-drop, there goes an eargasm 
Now you cumming out the side of your face 
We tapping right into your memory banksâthanks! 
So click it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened 
Trunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat 'rassling 
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag 
Make it sound like aluminum cans in the bag 
But I know y'all wanted that 808 
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass? 
But I know y'all wanted that 808

 [Big Boi:] 
The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee 
Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me? 
Well I was looking at them, there there on the dancefloor 
Now they got me in the middle, feeling like a manwhore 
Especially the big girl 
Big girls need love too, no discrimination here, squirrel 
So keep your hands off my cheeks 
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak 
Skinny-slim women got the cameltoe within them 
You can hump them, lift them, bend them 
Give them something to remember 
Yell out "Timber!" when you fall through the chop shop 
Take a deep breath and exhale 
Your ex-male friend/boyfriend's boring as hell 
But let me listen to the story you tell 
And we can make moves like a person in jail 
On the low, ho 
 
 [Sleepy Brown:] 
I like the way you move 
I like the way you move, wooo 
I love the way you move 
I love the way, I love the way 
I love the way you move

Hey, baby, girl, don't you stop it 
Come on, lady, dance all around me 
(Look so fine) You look so fine (Look so fine) 
You driving me out of my, out of my mind 
Out my mind, ooooh, baby

Oooh, 'cause you light me, and excite me 
And you know, you got me baby, woo!

I'm not a perfect person 
There's many things I wish I didn't do 
But I continue learning 
I never meant to do those things to you 
And so I have to say before I go 
That I just want you to know 
 
I've found a reason for me 
To change who I used to be 
A reason to start over new 
And the reason is you 
 
I'm sorry that I hurt you 
It's something I must live with everyday 
And all the pain I put you through 
I wish that I could take it all away 
And be the one who catches all your tears 
That's why I need you to hear 
 
I've found a reason for me 
To change who I used to be 
A reason to start over new 
And the reason is you 
 
And the reason is you 
And the reason is you 
And the reason is you 
 
I'm not a perfect person 
I never meant to do those things to you 
And so I have to say before I go 
That I just want you to know 
 
I've found a reason for me 
To change who I used to be 
A reason to start over new 
And the reason is you 
 
I've found a reason to show 
A side of me you didn't know 
A reason for all that I do 
And the reason is you

Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)

But separate's always better when there's feelings involved (Ah) 
If what they say is, "Nothing is forever" 
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes 
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception? 
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh

My goodies, my goodies, my goodies 
Not my goodies 
 
 [Petey Pablo:] 
I got a sick reputation for handling broads 
All I need is me a few seconds or more 
And it's a wrap 
Tell valet to bring my 'Lac 
And I ain't comin' back 
So you can put a car right there (Put a car right there) 
I'm the truth 
And I ain't got nothin' to prove 
And you can ask anybody 
'Cause they seen me do it (They seen me do it) 
Barricades, I run right through 'em 
Used to 'em 
Throw all the dirt you want, I'm used to it (It's no use)

On her back, picking out baskets of fruit 
I love you, boo 
Yeah, Freaky Petey love you too, ha-ha 
You know how I do it (That goodie goodie) 
 
 [Ciara:] 
You may look at me and think that I'm just a young girl 
But I'm not just a young girl 
Baby, this is what I'm looking for 
Sexy, independent, gotta spend-it type that's gettin' his dough

So damn hot, but so young 
You ain't got milk on ya tongue 
Slow down little one 
And you ain't got it all 
Hey shorty, you don't play the game (Wait a minute) 
You think you bad, but you ain't bad 
I'll show you what bad is 
Bad is when you're capable of beatin' the baddest 
I've been workin' at it ever since I came to this planet 
I ain't quite there yet, but I'm gettin' better at it 
Matter of fact 
Lemme tell it to you one mo' 'gain 
All I got to do is tell a girl who I am (Petey) 
Ain't ne'er chick in here that I can't have 
Bada boom, bada bam bam bam (I'm Bad) 
 
 [Ciara:] 
You're insinuating that I'm hot 
But these goodies boy, are not

Throw ya hands in the air right now man... 
Feel this shit right here...  
 
 [Verse 1 - Fat Joe a.k.a Joey Crack] 
I don't give a fuck 'bout your fault or mishappenin's, 
Nigga we from the Bronx, New York... shit happens, 
Kids clappin' love to spark the place, 
Half the niggas on the squad got a scar on they face, 
It's a cold world, and this is ice, 
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga this is life. 
Got the phantom in front building Trinity Ave. 
10 years been legit they still figure me bad. 
As a youngin', I was too much to cope with. 
Why you think, mo'fuckers nick-named me, Cook Coke shit. 
Should've been called armed robbery, extorsion or maybe grand larceny... 
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle, 
This long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble. 
Came out the gate, no I didn't flow Joe shit. 
Fat nigga with shotty was the logo kid. 
 
 [Chorus] 
Said my niggas don't dance, 
we just pull up our pants and, 
Do the Roc-away. 
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back. 
I said my niggas don't dance, 
See we just pull up our pants and, 
Do the Roc-away. 
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back. 
 
 [Verse 2 - Remy] 
R to the E'zzy', 
M to the whizz-i  [Y] , 
My arms stay breezy,  
The Don's stay fizz-i, 
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 740'fizz-i 
And I just bought a bike so I can ride til' I die, 
With a matchin' jacket, 
Bout' to cop me a mansion, 
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'. 
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance- we boogie, 
So nevermind how we got in here with the burners and hoodies. 
Listen we don't pay admission, 
And bouncers don't check us, 
And we walk around the metal detectors. 
And there really ain't no need for a VIP section in the middle of the dance floor, 
Reckless, check it, said it?! 
Like my necklace, started relaxin' now, that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction. 
See, money ain't a thing nigga, we still the same nigga, flows just changed  
now we 'bout to change the game nigga. 
 
 [Chorus] 
Said my niggas don't dance, 
we just pull up our pants and, 
Do the Roc-away. 
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back. 
I said my niggas don't dance, 
we just pull up our pants and, 
Do the Roc-away. 
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back. 
 
 [Verse 3 - Fat Joe a.k.a Joey Crack] 
Now we livin' better now,  
Gucci sweater now, 
And that G4 could fly through, any weather now, 
See niggas get tight, when you worth some millions. 
That's why I sport the chincilla to hurt they feelin's. 
Your can find Joe Crack at all type of shit, 
Out at Vegas front roll on all the fights and shit, 
If I visited Compton, they'd prolly squeel. 
'Cause half these rappers get "Blow" like Dereck Foreal. 
If you cross the line damn right, I'm gon' hurt you, 
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercials. 
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up, 
B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up. 
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about rucker, 
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the rucker, 
Not even Pee-Wee Kirkland could imagine this, 
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship. 
 
 [Chorus] 
my niggas don't dance, 
we just pull up our pants and, 
Do the Roc-away. 
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back. 
I said my niggas don't dance, 
we just pull up our pants and, 
Do the Roc-away. 
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.
