Sweet love, yeah 
 
I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so 
I should've held on tight, I never should've let you go 
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid, I was foolish 
I was lying to myself 
I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love 
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself 
Guess I didn't know you, guess I didn't know me 
But I thought I knew everything I never felt 
 
The feeling that I'm feeling now that I don't hear your voice 
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice 
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side 
Right here, 'cause, baby (We belong together) 
 
When you left, I lost a part of me (Together) 
It's still so hard to believe 
Come back, baby, please 
(Come back, come back, come back, come back) 
'Cause we belong together 
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who else) 
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who else) 
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who else) 
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together 
 
I can't sleep at night, when you are on my mind 
Bobby Womack's on the radio 
Singing to me, "If you think you're lonely now" 
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep) 
I gotta change the station 
So I turn the dial, tryin' to catch a break 
And then I hear Babyface, "I only think of you" 
And it's breaking my heart 
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm falling apart 
 
I'm feelin' all out of my element 
Throwin' things, cryin' 
Tryin' to figure out where the hell I went wrong 
The pain reflected in this song 
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside 
I need you, need you back in my life, baby (My life, my life) 
(We belong together) 
 
When you left, I lost a part of me (Together) 
It's still so hard to believe 
Come back, baby, please 
(Come back, come back, come back, come back) 
'Cause we belong together 
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who will?) 
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?) 
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?) 
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby 
(We belong together) (Who will?) 
 
When you left, I lost a part of me (Who will?) 
It's still so hard to believe (Who will?) 
Come back, baby, please 
(Come back, come back, come back, come back) 
'Cause we belong together 
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who will?) 
Who's gonna talk to me 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?) 
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?) 
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together 
 
(Who will? Who will? Who will?) 
We belong together

 [Kanye West:] 
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon 
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm 
She said, "I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm 
Far as girls, you got a flock 
I can tell by your charm and your arm" 
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her? 
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena 
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids 
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz? 
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends 
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in 
We all went to din' and then I had to pay 
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid 
You know why? It take too much to touch her 
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta 
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher 
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his 
You will see him on TV any given Sunday

She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money 
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money 
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money 
Should've got that insured, Geico for your money 
If you ain't no punk

You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave

But while y'all washin', watch him 
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun

This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries 
So stick by his side

Let me hear that back


I walk a lonely road 
The only one that I have ever known 
Don't know where it goes 
But it's home to me and I walk alone 
 
I walk this empty street 
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams 
Where the city sleeps 
And I'm the only one and I walk alone 
 
I walk alone 
I walk alone 
I walk alone 
I walk a 
 
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me 
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating 
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me 
'Til then I walk alone 
 
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah 
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah 
 
I'm walking down the line 
That divides me somewhere in my mind 
On the borderline 
Of the edge and where I walk alone 
 
Read between the lines 
Of what's fucked up and everything's alright 
Check my vital signs 
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone 
 
I walk alone 
I walk alone 
I walk alone 
I walk a 
 
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me 
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating 
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me 
'Til then I walk alone 
 
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah 
Ah-ah, ah-ah 
 
I walk alone 
I walk a 
 
I walk this empty street 
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams 
Where the city sleeps 
And I'm the only one and I walk a 
 
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me 
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating 
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me 
'Til then I walk alone

In the hotel or in the back of the rental 
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into 
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor 
Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I got you 
Wanna show me you could work it, baby? No problem 
Get on top, then get to bounce around like a low rider 
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit 
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick 
I'm tryin' to explain, baby, the best way I can

Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo

'Cause I ain't never put it down like this 
Soon as I come through the door 
She get to pullin' on my zipper 
It's like it's a race, who can get undressed quicker 
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs? 
Had me thinkin' 'bout that ass after I'm gone 
I touched the right spot at the right time 
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind 
So seductive, you should see the way she whine 
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind 
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin' 
Drippin' wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin' 
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on 
And we gon' sip 'til every bubble in every bottle is gone

You wanna play with a player girl then play on 
Strip out the Chanel

Watch me and I'mma watch you at the same time 
Looking at you wanna break my back 
You're the very reason why I keep a pack of the Magnum 
And with the wagon hit you in the back of the Magnum 
For the record, don't think it was something you did 
Shorty all on me 'cause it's hard to resist the kid

Don't you wish your girlfriend was fun like me? 
Big thrills 
Don't you? 
Don't you?


Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh-oh, oh, oh 
 
Seems like just yesterday 
You were a part of me 
I used to stand so tall 
I used to be so strong 
Your arms around me tight 
Everything, it felt so right 
Unbreakable, like nothin' could go wrong 
Now I can't breathe 
No, I can't sleep 
I'm barely hanging on 
 
Here I am, once again 
I'm torn into pieces 
Can't deny it, can't pretend 
Just thought you were the one 
Broken up, deep inside 
But you won't get to see the tears I cry 
Behind these hazel eyes 
 
I told you everything 
Opened up and let you in 
You made me feel alright 
For once in my life 
Now all that's left of me 
Is what I pretend to be 
So together, but so broken up inside 
'Cause I can't breathe 
No, I can't sleep 
I'm barely hangin' on 
 
Here I am, once again 
I'm torn into pieces 
Can't deny it, can't pretend 
Just thought you were the one 
Broken up, deep inside 
But you won't get to see the tears I cry 
Behind these hazel eyes 
 
Swallow me then spit me out 
For hating you, I blame myself 
Seeing you it kills me now 
No, I don't cry on the outside 
Anymore 
Anymore 
 
Here I am, once again 
I'm torn into pieces 
Can't deny it, can't pretend 
Just thought you were the one 
Broken up, deep inside 
But you won't get to see the tears I cry 
Behind these hazel eyes 
 
Here I am, once again 
I'm torn into pieces 
Can't deny it, can't pretend 
Just thought you were the one 
Broken up, deep inside 
But you won't get to see the tears I cry 
Behind these hazel eyes
