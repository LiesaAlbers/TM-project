Wake up in the morning feelin' like P. Diddy (Hey. What up, girl?) 
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city (Let's go) 
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack 
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back 
 
I'm talkin' pedicure on our toes, toes 
Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes 
Boys blowin' up our phones, phones 
Drop-toppin', playin' our favorite CDs 
Pullin' up to the parties 
Tryna get a little bit tipsy 
 
Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up 
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight 
Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no 
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, oh 
Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up 
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight 
Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no 
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, oh 
 
Ain't got a care in the world, but got plenty of beer 
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here 
And now the dudes are linin' up, 'cause they hear we got swagger 
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger 
 
I'm talkin' 'bout everybody gettin' crunk, crunk 
Boys tryna touch my junk, junk 
Gonna smack him if he gettin' too drunk, drunk 
No-now we go until they kick us out, out or the police shut us down, down 
Police shut us down, down, po-po shut us down 
 
Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up 
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight 
Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no 
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, oh 
Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up 
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight 
Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no 
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, oh 
 
(DJ) You build me up, you break me down 
My heart, it pounds, yeah, you got me 
With my hands up, you got me now 
You got that sound, yeah, you got me 
(DJ) You build me up, you break me down 
My heart, it pounds, yeah, you got me 
With my hands up, put your hands up 
Put your hands up 
 
Now, the party don't start 'til I walk in 
 
Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up 
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight 
Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no 
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, oh 
Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up 
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight 
Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no 
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, oh


"Hey, sorry I missed your call, just leave a message after the beep" 
"Hey, yeah, it's me, just been thinking about everything tonight 
And I don't know, I just miss you so much 
Give me a call back if you can?" 
 
Picture perfect memories 
Scattered all around the floor 
Reachin' for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore 
 
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind 
For me, it happens all the time 
 
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now 
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now 
And I don't know how I can do without 
I just need you now 
 
Another shot of whiskey 
Can't stop lookin' at the door 
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before 
 
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind 
For me, it happens all the time 
 
It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now 
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now 
And I don't know how I can do without 
I just need you now 
Whoa, oh 
 
I guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all 
 
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now 
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now 
And I don't know how I can do without 
I just need you now 
 
I just need you now 
Oh baby, I need you now


Hey 
He-e-e-e-ey 
He-e-e-e-ey 
 
Your lipstick stains 
On the front lobe of my left-side brains 
I knew I wouldn't forget you 
And so I went and let you blow my mind 
Your sweet moonbeam 
The smell of you in every single dream I dream 
I knew when we collided 
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind 
 
Hey, soul sister 
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo? 
The way you move ain't fair, you know 
Hey, soul sister 
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do 
Tonight 
 
Hey 
He-e-e-e-ey 
He-e-e-e-ey 
 
Just in time 
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me 
You gave my life direction 
A game-show love connection we can't deny 
I'm so obsessed 
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest 
I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna 
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind 
 
Hey, soul sister 
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo? 
The way you move ain't fair, you know 
Hey, soul sister 
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do 
Tonight 
 
The way you can cut a rug 
Watching you's the only drug I need 
So gangster, I'm so thug 
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see 
I can be myself now finally 
In fact, there's nothing I can't be 
I want the world to see you'll be with me 
 
Hey, soul sister 
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo? 
The way you move ain't fair, you know 
Hey, soul sister 
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do tonight 
Hey, soul sister 
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do 
Tonight

Greetings, loved ones 
Let's take a journey 
 
 [Katy:] 
I know a place 
Where the grass is really greener 
Warm, wet and wild 
There must be something in the water 
Sippin' gin and juice 
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone) 
The boys break their necks 
Tryna creep a little sneak peek (at us) 
 
You could travel the world 
But nothing comes close 
To the golden coast 
Once you party with us 
You'll be falling in love 
 
California girls 
We're unforgettable 
Daisy Dukes 
Bikinis on top 
Sun-kissed skin 
So hot 
We'll melt your popsicle 
 
California girls 
We're undeniable 
Fine, fresh, fierce 
We got it on lock 
West Coast represent 
Now put your hands up 
 
Sex on the beach 
We don't mind sand in our stilettos 
We freak in my Jeep 
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo

[Hayley Williams:] 
Can we pretend that airplanes 
In the night sky are like shooting stars? 
I could really use a wish right now 
A wish right now 
A wish right now 
Can we pretend that airplanes 
In the night sky 
Are like shooting stars? 
I could really use a wish right now 
A wish right now 
A wish right now 
 
 [B.o.B:] 
Yeah, I could use a dream or a Genie or a wish 
To go back to a place much simpler than this 
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin' 
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion 
And all the pandemonium and all the madness 
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness 
And when you're starin' at that phone in your lap 
And you're hopin' but them people never call you back 
But that's just how the story unfolds 
You get another hand soon after you fold 
And when your plans unravel in the sand 
What would you wish for if you had one chance? 
So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late 
I'm on my way so don't close that gate 
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight 
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night 
 
 [Hayley Williams (B.o.B):] 
Can we pretend that airplanes 
In the night sky are like shooting stars? (Shooting stars) 
I could really use a wish right now (Wish right now) 
Wish right now (Wish right now) 
Wish right now (Wish right now) 
Can we pretend that airplanes 
In the night sky 
Are like shooting stars? (Shooting stars) 
I could really use a wish right now (Wish right now) 
Wish right now (Wish right now) 
Wish right now (Wish right now) 
 
 [B.o.B:] 
Yeah, yeah, somebody take me back to the days 
Before this was a job, before I got paid 
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank 
Yeah, back when I was tryin' to get a tip at Subway 
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it 
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant 
I'm guessin' that if we could make some wishes outta' airplanes 
Then maybe oh maybe I'd go back to the days 
Before the politics that we call the rap game 
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape 
And back before I tried to cover up my slang 
But this is for Decatur 
What's up, Bobby Ray? 
So can I get a wish 
To end the politics 
And get back to the music 
That started this shit? 
So here I stand and then again I say 
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes outta' airplanes 
 
 [Hayley Williams (B.o.B):] 
Can we pretend that airplanes 
In the night sky are like shooting stars? (Shooting stars) 
I could really use a wish right now (Wish right now) 
Wish right now (Wish right now) 
Wish right now (Wish right now) 
Can we pretend that airplanes 
In the night sky 
Are like shooting stars? (Shooting stars) 
I could really use a wish right now (Wish right now) 
Wish right now (Wish right now) 
Wish right now (Wish right now) 
 
 [B.o.B (Hayley Williams):] 
I could really use a wish right now (oh, oh-oh oh) 
I-I-I could really use a wish right now 
Like, like, like shootin' stars (oh, oh... oh) 
I-I-I-I could really use a wish right now 
A wish, a wish right now 
(A wish right now)


Just gonna stand there and watch me burn 
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts 
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry 
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie 
I love the way you lie 
 
I can't tell you what it really is 
I can only tell you what it feels like 
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe 
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight 
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight 
High off her love, drunk from her hate 
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate 
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me 
She fucking hates me and I love it 
"Wait! Where you going?" 
"I'm leaving you!" 
"No you ain't. Come back" 
We're running right back 
Here we go again 
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great 
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane 
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snap 
"Who's that dude?" 
"I don't even know his name" 
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again 
I guess I don't know my own strength 
 
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn 
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts 
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry 
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie 
I love the way you lie 
I love the way you lie 
 
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em 
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em 
Got that warm fuzzy feeling 
Yeah, them chills used to get 'em 
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em 
You swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em 
Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them 
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em 
Throw 'em down, pin 'em 
So lost in the moments when you're in them 
It's the rage that took over 
It controls you both 
So they say it's best to go your separate ways 
Guess that they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday 
Yesterday is over, it's a different day 
Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her 
Next time you'd show restraint 
You don't get another chance 
Life is no Nintendo game 
But you lied again 
Now you get to watch her leave out the window 
Guess that's why they call it window pane 
 
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn 
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts 
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry 
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie 
I love the way you lie 
I love the way you lie 
 
Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean 
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines 
But your temper's just as bad as mine is 
You're the same as me 
When it comes to love you're just as blinded 
Baby, please come back 
It wasn't you, baby it was me 
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems 
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano 
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though 
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk 
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk 
Told you this is my fault 
Look me in the eyeball 
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall 
Next time? There won't be no next time! 
I apologize even though I know it's lies 
I'm tired of the games I just want her back 
I know I'm a liar 
If she ever tries to fucking leave again 
I'mma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire 
I'm just gonna 
 
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn 
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts 
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry 
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie 
I love the way you lie 
I love the way you lie

Saying AYO! Gotta let go! 
I wanna celebrate and live my life 
Saying AYO! Baby, let's go! 
 
'Cause we gon' rock this club 
We gon' go all night 
We gon' light it up 
Like it's dynamite! 
'Cause I told you once 
Now I told you twice 
We gon' light it up 
Like it's dynamite!


Now listen to me, baby, 
Before I love and leave you. 
They call me heart breaker. 
I don't wanna deceive you. 
 
If you fall for me, 
I'm not easy to please. 
I might tear you apart. 
Told you from the start. 
Baby, from the start. 
 
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart. 
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart. 
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart. 
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart. 
 
There's no point tryna hide it. 
No point tryna evade it. 
I know I got a problem. 
Problem with misbehaving. 
 
If you fall for me, 
I'm not easy to please. 
I might tear you apart. 
Told you from the start. 
Baby, from the start. 
 
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart. 
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart. 
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart. 
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart. 
 
And I know karma's gonna get me back for being so cold. 
Like a big bad wolf I'm born to be bad and bad to the bone. 
If you fall for me I'm only gonna tear you apart. 
Told ya from the start. 
 
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart. 
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart. 
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart. 
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart.
