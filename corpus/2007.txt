To the left, to the left 
To the left, to the left 
Mm 
 
To the left, to the left 
Everything you own in the box to the left 
In the closet, that's my stuff 
Yes, if I bought it, please don't touch (Don't touch) 
And keep talking that mess, that's fine 
But could you walk and talk at the same time? 
And, it's my name that's on that Jag 
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab 
 
Standing in the front yard 
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool 
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you 
You got me twisted 
 
You must not know 'bout me 
You must not know 'bout me 
I could have another you in a minute 
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby 
You must not know 'bout me 
You must not know 'bout me 
I can have another you by tomorrow 
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking 
You're irreplaceable 
 
So go ahead and get gone 
Call up that chick and see if she's home 
Oops, I bet you thought, that I didn't know 
What did you think I was putting you out for? 
'Cause you was untrue 
Rollin' her 'round in the car that I bought you 
Baby, drop them keys 
Hurry up before your taxi leaves 
 
Standing in the front yard 
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool 
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you 
You got me twisted 
 
You must not know 'bout me 
You must not know 'bout me 
I could have another you in a minute 
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby 
You must not know 'bout me 
You must not know 'bout me 
I will have another you by tomorrow 
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking 
You're irreplaceable (Irreplaceable) 
 
So since I'm not your everything (Irreplaceable) 
How about I'll be nothing (Nothing) 
Nothing at all to you (Nothing) 
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you (I won't shed a tear) 
I won't lose a wink of sleep 
'Cause the truth of the matter is 
Replacing you was so easy 
 
To the left, to the left 
To the left, to the left 
Mm 
To the left, to the left 
Everything you own in the box to the left 
To the left, to the left 
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking 
You're irreplaceable 
 
You must not know 'bout me 
You must not know 'bout me 
I could have another you in a minute 
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby 
You must not know 'bout me 
You must not know 'bout me 
I can have another you by tomorrow 
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking 
You must not know 'bout me (Baby, yeah) 
You must not know 'bout me 
I could have another you in a minute 
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute 
You can pack all your bags, we're finished 
(You must not know 'bout me) 
'Cause you made your bed, now lay in it 
(You must not know 'bout me) 
I can have another you by tomorrow 
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking 
You're irreplaceable

Uh-huh, uh-huh (Take three, action) 
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Hov) 
 
No clouds in my stones 
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank 
Coming down with the Dow Jones 
When the clouds come, we gone, we Roc-A-Fella 
We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better 
You know me (You know me) 
In anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day 
JayâRain Man is back 
With Little Miss Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at? 
 
You have my heart 
And we'll never be worlds apart 
Maybe in magazines 
But you'll still be my star 
Baby, 'cause in the dark 
You can't see shiny cars 
And that's when you need me there 
With you, I'll always share 
Because 
 
When the sun shine, we shine together 
Told you I'll be here forever 
Said I'll always be your friend 
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end 
Now that it's raining more than ever 
Know that we'll still have each other 
You can stand under my umbrella 
You can stand under my umbrellaâellaâella, eh, eh, eh 
Under my umbrellaâellaâella, eh, eh, eh 
Under my umbrellaâellaâella, eh, eh, eh 
Under my umbrellaâellaâella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh 
 
These fancy things 
Will never come in between 
You're part of my entity 
Here for infinity 
When the war has took its part 
When the world has dealt its cards 
If the hand is hard 
Together we'll mend your heart 
Because 
 
When the sun shine, we shine together 
Told you I'll be here forever 
Said I'll always be your friend 
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end 
Now that it's raining more than ever 
Know that we'll still have each other 
You can stand under my umbrella 
You can stand under my umbrellaâellaâella, eh, eh, eh 
Under my umbrellaâellaâella, eh, eh, eh 
Under my umbrellaâellaâella, eh, eh, eh 
Under my umbrellaâellaâella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh 
 
You can run into my arms 
It's okay, don't be alarmed 
Come into me 
There's no distance in between our love 
So gon' and let the rain pour 
I'll be all you need and more 
Because 
 
When the sun shine, we shine together 
Told you I'll be here forever 
Said I'll always be your friend 
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end 
Now that it's raining more than ever

 [Gwen Stefani:] 
If I could escape, I would 
But first of all, let me say 
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way 
'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor 
It's your fault, you didn't shut the refrigerator 
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold 
 
If I could escape (Escape) 
And recreate a place that's my own world (Own world) 
And I could be your favorite girl (Forever), perfectly together 
And tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape) 
If I could be sweet (Be sweet) 
I know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change) 
I didn't mean for you to get hurt (Whatsoever) 
We can make it better 
And tell me, boy, now, wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape, sweet escape) 
 
 [Akon:] 
(Woo-hoo, yee-hoo, woo-hoo, yee-hoo) 
I wanna get away (Get away) to our sweet escape (Sweet escape) 
(Woo-hoo, yee-hoo, woo-hoo, yee-hoo) 
I wanna get away (Get away), yeah (Yeah) 
 
 [Gwen Stefani:] 
You melt me down, I'm at my lowest boiling point 
Come help me out, I need to get me out of this joint 
Come on, let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around 
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground 
So baby, times get a little crazy 
I've been gettin' a little lazy 
Waitin' on you to come save me 
I can see that you're angry by the way that you treat me 
Hopefully you don't leave me, wanna take you with me 
 
If I could escape (Escape) 
And recreate a place that's my own world (Own world) 
And I could be your favorite girl (Forever), perfectly together 
And tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape) 
If I could be sweet (Be sweet) 
I know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change) 
I didn't mean for you to get hurt (Whatsoever) 
We can make it better 
And tell me, boy, now, wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape, sweet escape)

The smell of your skin lingers on me now. 
You're probably on your flight back to your home town. 
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby, 
To be with myself and center clarity, peace, serenity. 
 
I hope you know, I hope you know 
That this has nothing to do with you. 
It's personal: myself and I. 
We've got some straightenin' out to do. 
 
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket, 
But I've got to get a move on with my life. 
It's time to be a big girl now. 
And big girls don't cry, 
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry. 
 
The path that I'm walking I must go alone. 
I must take the baby steps 'til I'm full-grown, full-grown. 
Fairytales don't always have a happy ending, do they? 
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay? 
 
I hope you know, I hope you know 
That this has nothing to do with you. 
It's personal: myself and I. 
We've got some straightenin' out to do. 
 
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket, 
But I've got to get a move on with my life. 
It's time to be a big girl now. 
And big girls don't cry. 
 
Like the little school mate in the school yard 
We'll play jacks and uno cards. 
I'll be your best friend and you'll be my Valentine. 
Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to 
'Cause I want to hold yours too. 
We'll be playmates and lovers and share our secret worlds. 
 
But it's time for me to go home. 
It's getting late and dark outside. 
I need to be with myself and center clarity, peace, serenity. 
 
I hope you know, I hope you know 
That this has nothing to do with you. 
It's personal: myself and I. 
We've got some straightenin' out to do. 
 
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket, 
But I've got to get a move on with my life. 
It's time to be a big girl now. 
And big girls don't cry, 
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

A certified dime piece, deserve Louis one three 
One fifty a shot, three for you and three for me 
I'm checking your body language, I love the conversation 
And when you lick your lips I get a tingling sensation 
Now were both 'bout tipsy, you say you in the mood 
All I need is 'bout a hour, better yet maybe two 
Let me take you where I live, Ferrari switch gears 
When I whisper in your ear, your legs hit the chandelier 
Passion fruit and sex all in the atmosphere 
I'ma let T-Pain sing it so he can make it clear

Right now, he's probably slow dancing 
With a bleached-blond tramp 
And she's probably getting frisky 
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink 
'Cause she can't shoot a whiskey 
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool stick 
Showing her how to shoot a combo 
And he don't know 
 
I dug my key into the side 
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive 
Carved my name into his leather seats 
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights 
Slashed a hole in all four tires 
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats 
 
Right now, she's probably up singing some 
White-trash version of Shania karaoke 
Right now, she's probably saying, "I'm drunk" 
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky 
Right now, he's probably dabbing on 
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo 
Oh, and he don't know  
 
Oh, that I dug my key into the side 
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive 
Carved my name into his leather seats 
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights 
Slashed a hole in all four tires 
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats 
 
I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl 
'Cause the next time that he cheats 
Oh, you know it won't be on me 
No, not on me 
 
'Cause I dug my key into the side 
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive 
Carved my name into his leather seats 
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights 
Slashed a hole in all four tires 
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats 
 
Oh, maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats 
Oh, before he cheats 
Oh


Hey there, Delilah 
What's it like in New York City? 
I'm a thousand miles away 
But girl, tonight you look so pretty 
Yes you do 
Times Square can't shine as bright as you 
I swear it's true 
 
Hey there, Delilah 
Don't you worry about the distance 
I'm right there if you get lonely 
Give this song another listen 
Close your eyes 
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise 
I'm by your side 
 
Oh it's what you do to me 
Oh it's what you do to me 
Oh it's what you do to me 
Oh it's what you do to me 
What you do to me 
 
Hey there, Delilah 
I know times are getting hard 
But just believe me, girl 
Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar 
We'll have it good 
We'll have the life we knew we would 
My word is good 
 
Hey there, Delilah 
I've got so much left to say 
If every simple song I wrote to you 
Would take your breath away 
I'd write it all 
Even more in love with me you'd fall 
We'd have it all 
 
Oh it's what you do to me 
Oh it's what you do to me 
Oh it's what you do to me 
Oh it's what you do to me 
 
A thousand miles seems pretty far 
But they've got planes and trains and cars 
I'd walk to you if I had no other way 
Our friends would all make fun of us 
And we'll just laugh along because we know 
That none of them have felt this way 
Delilah, I can promise you 
That by the time we get through 
The world will never ever be the same 
And you're to blame 
 
Hey there, Delilah 
You be good and don't you miss me 
Two more years and you'll be done with school 
And I'll be making history like I do 
You'll know it's all because of you 
We can do whatever we want to 
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you 
This one's for you 
 
Oh it's what you do to me 
Oh it's what you do to me 
Oh it's what you do to me 
Oh it's what you do to me 
What you do to me

We flying the first class 
Up in the sky. 
Poppin' champagne, 
Livin' the life 
In the fast lane, 
And I won't change 
By the glamorous, oh, the flossy flossy 
 
The glamorous 
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life) 
By the glamorous, oh, the flossy flossy

By the glamorous, oh, the flossy flossy 
 
Wear them gold and diamonds rings 
All them things don't mean a thing 
Chaperons and limousines 
Shopping for expensive things 
 
I be on the movie screens 
Magazines and bougie scenes 
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine 
I'm no queen, I'm no machine 
 
I still go to Taco Bell 
Drive through, raw as hell 
I don't care, I'm still real 
No matter how many records I sell 
 
After the show or after the Grammies 
I like to go cool out with the family 
Sippin', reminiscing on days 
When I had a Mustang 
And now I'm in... 
 
We flying the first class 
Up in the sky. 
Poppin' champagne, 
Livin' the life 
In the fast lane. 
And I won't change

You deserve nothing but all the finer things 
Now this whole world has no clue what to do with us 
I've got enough money in the bank for the two of us 
Plus I gotta keep enough lettuce 
To support your shoe fetish 
Lifestyles so rich and famous 
Robin Leach will get jealous 
Half a million for the stones 
Taking trips from here to Rome 
So If you ain't got no money take your broke ass home 
 
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S 
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S 
 
We flying the first class 
Up in the sky. 
Poppin' champagne, 
Livin' the life 
In the fast lane. 
I won't change 
By the glamorous, oh, the flossy flossy. 
 
The glamorous 
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life) 
By the glamorous, oh, the flossy flossy. 
The glamorous 
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life) 
By the glamorous, oh, the flossy flossy. 
 
I got problems up to here 
I've got people in my ear 
Telling me these crazy things 
That I don't want to know (fuck y'all) 
 
I've got money in the bank 
And I'd really like to thank 
All the fans, I'd like to thank 
Thank you really though 
 
'Cause I remember yesterday 
When I dreamt about the days 
When I'd rock on MTV, 
That'd be really dope 
 
Damn, It's been a long road 
And the industry is cold 
I'm glad my daddy told me so, 
He let his daughter know 
 
(If you ain't got no money take your broke ass home) 
My daddy told me so 
(If you ain't got no money take your broke ass home) 
He let his daughter know 
(I said if you ain't got no money take your broke ass home) 
My daddy told me so 
(If you ain't go no money take your broke ass home) 
He let his daughter know
