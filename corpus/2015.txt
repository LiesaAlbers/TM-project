When your legs don't work like they used to before 
And I can't sweep you off of your feet 
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love? 
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks? 
 
And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70 
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23 
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways 
Maybe just the touch of a hand 
Well, meâI fall in love with you every single day 
And I just wanna tell you I am 
 
So, honey, now 
Take me into your loving arms 
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars 
Place your head on my beating heart 
I'm thinking out loud 
Maybe we found love right where we are 
 
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades 
And the crowds don't remember my name 
When my hands don't play the strings the same way (mmm...) 
I know you will still love me the same 
 
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen 
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory 
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways 
Maybe it's all part of a plan 
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes 
Hoping that you'll understand 
 
That, baby, now 
Take me into your loving arms 
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars 
Place your head on my beating heart 
Thinking out loud 
Maybe we found love right where we are (oh, oh) 
 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lo-ud 
 
So, baby, now 
Take me into your loving arms 
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars 
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart 
I'm thinking out loud 
But maybe we found love right where we are 
Oh, baby, we found love right where we are 
And we found love right where we are

Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture 
Those were the days, hard work forever pays 
Now I see you in a better place (See you in a better place)

First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong 
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond 
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost 
(The love will never get lost) 
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed 
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn 
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone 
(Remember me when I'm gone) 
 
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got? 
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side 
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride 
 
 [Charlie Puth:] 
So let the light guide your way, yeah 
Hold every memory as you go 
And every road you take 
Will always lead you home, home

"Oh, don't you dare look back 
Just keep your eyes on me." 
I said, "You're holding back." 
She said, "Shut up and dance with me!" 
This woman is my destiny 
She said, "Ooh-ooh-hoo 
Shut up and dance with me." 
 
We were victims of the night 
The chemical, physical, kryptonite 
Helpless to the bass and the fading light 
Oh, we were bound to get together 
Bound to get together 
 
She took my arm 
I don't know how it happened 
We took the floor and she said 
 
"Oh, don't you dare look back 
Just keep your eyes on me." 
I said, "You're holding back." 
She said, "Shut up and dance with me!" 
This woman is my destiny 
She said, "Ooh-ooh-hoo 
Shut up and dance with me." 
 
A backless dress and some beat-up sneaks 
My discothÃ¨que Juliet, teenage dream 
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me 
I knew we were bound to be together 
Bound to be together 
 
She took my arm 
I don't know how it happened 
We took the floor and she said 
 
"Oh, don't you dare look back 
Just keep your eyes on me." 
I said, "You're holding back." 
She said, "Shut up and dance with me!" 
This woman is my destiny 
She said, "Ooh-ooh-hoo 
Shut up and dance with me." 
 
Oh, come on girl 
 
Deep in her eyes 
I think I see the future 
I realize this is my last chance 
 
She took my arm 
I don't know how it happened 
We took the floor and she said 
 
"Oh, don't you dare look back 
Just keep your eyes on me." 
I said, "You're holding back." 
She said, "Shut up and dance with me!" 
This woman is my destiny

Nice to meet you, where you been? 
I could show you incredible things 
Magic, madness, heaven, sin 
Saw you there, and I thought 
"Oh my God, look at that face 
You look like my next mistake 
Love's a game, wanna play?" 
Ayy 
 
New money, suit and tie 
I can read you like a magazine 
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly 
And I know you heard about me 
So hey, let's be friends 
I'm dying to see how this one ends 
Grab your passport and my hand 
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend 
 
So it's gonna be forever 
Or it's gonna go down in flames 
You can tell me when it's over, mm 
If the high was worth the pain 
Got a long list of ex-lovers 
They'll tell you I'm insane 
'Cause you know I love the players 
And you love the game 
 
'Cause we're young and we're reckless 
We'll take this way too far 
It'll leave you breathless, hmm 
Or with a nasty scar 
Got a long list of ex-lovers 
They'll tell you I'm insane 
But I've got a blank space, baby 
And I'll write your name 
 
Cherry lips, crystal skies 
I could show you incredible things 
Stolen kisses, pretty lies 
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen 
Find out what you want 
Be that girl for a month 
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no 
 
Screaming, crying, perfect storms 
I can make all the tables turn 
Rose garden filled with thorns 
Keep you second guessing like 
"Oh my God, who is she?" 
I get drunk on jealousy 
But you'll come back each time you leave 
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream 
 
So it's gonna be forever 
Or it's gonna go down in flames 
You can tell me when it's over, mm 
If the high was worth the pain 
Got a long list of ex-lovers 
They'll tell you I'm insane 
'Cause you know I love the players 
And you love the game 
 
'Cause we're young and we're reckless 
We'll take this way too far 
It'll leave you breathless, hmm 
Or with a nasty scar 
Got a long list of ex-lovers 
They'll tell you I'm insane 
But I've got a blank space, baby 
And I'll write your name 
 
Boys only want love if it's torture 
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya 
Boys only want love if it's torture 
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya 
 
So it's gonna be forever 
Or it's gonna go down in flames 
You can tell me when it's over, mm 
If the high was worth the pain 
Got a long list of ex-lovers 
They'll tell you I'm insane 
'Cause you know I love the players 
And you love the game 
 
'Cause we're young and we're reckless 
We'll take this way too far 
It'll leave you breathless, hmm 
Or with a nasty scar 
Got a long list of ex-lovers 
They'll tell you I'm insane 
But I've got a blank space, baby 
And I'll write your name
