You that faggot-ass nigga tryin' to pull me back, right? 
When my joint get to pumpin' in the club, it's on 
I wink my eye at yo' bitch, if she smiles, she gone 
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn 
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned

"Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up 
If niggas hate, then let them hate, and watch the money pile up" 
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub' 
They know where we fuckin' be

Geah! History in the making 
Part two! 
It's so crazy right now 
 
I look and stare so deep in your eyes (I) 
I touch on you more and more every time 
When you leave, I'm begging you not to go 
Call your name, two, three times in a row 
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain 
How I'm feeling, and my pride is the one to blame (Yeah) 
'Cause I know I don't understand 
Just how your love can do what no one else can 
 
Got me looking so crazy right now 
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no 
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no 
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no 
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no 
 
When I talk to my friends so quietly 
("Who he think he is?") Look at what you did to me 
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress 
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress 
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew 
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you 
But I still don't understand 
Just how your love can do what no one else can 
 
Got me looking so crazy right now 
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now 
(Oh, crazy, your love) 
Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love) 
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Oh, your touch) 
Got me hoping you'll page me right now

Stick bony, but the pockets is fat like Tony (Oh, no) 
Soprano, the ROC handle like Van Exel 
I shake phonies man you can't get next to 
The genuine article, I do not sing though 
I sling though, if anything, I bling yo 
A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret 
You crazy? Bring ya whole set 
JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged 
They can't figure him out, they like, "Hey, is he insane?" (Oh, no) 
Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth 
My texture is the best fur: chinchilla 
I've been iller than chain smokers 
How you think I got the name Hova? 
I been realer, the game's over 
Fall back, Young 
Ever since I made the change over to platinum 
The game's been a wrap, one 
 
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby 
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this 
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care 
'Cause your love's got the best of me 
And baby you're making a fool of me 
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees 
'Cause baby you got me, you got me 
You got me, you got me so crazy, baby 
Hey! 
 
Got me looking so crazy right now 
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love) 
Got me looking so crazy right now

Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now 
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking

There's another world inside of me that you may never see 
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide 
But somewhere in this darkness 
There's a light that I can't find 
Well maybe it's too far away, yeah 
Or maybe I'm just blind 
Or maybe I'm just blind 
 
So hold me when I'm here 
Right me when I'm wrong 
Hold me when I'm scared 
And love me when I'm gone 
Everything I am and everything in me 
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be 
I'd never let you down 
Even if I could 
I'd give up everything 
If only for your good 
So hold me when I'm here 
Right me when I'm wrong 
You can hold me when I'm scared 
You won't always be there 
So love me when I'm gone 
Love me when I'm gone 
 
When your education X-ray 
Cannot see under my skin 
I won't tell you a damn thing 
That I could not tell my friends 
Roaming through this darkness 
I'm alive, but I'm alone 
And part of me is fighting this 
But part of me is gone 
 
So hold me when I'm here 
Right me when I'm wrong 
Hold me when I'm scared 
And love me when I'm gone 
Everything I am and everything in me 
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be 
I'd never let you down 
Even if I could 
I'd give up everything 
If only for your good 
So hold me when I'm here 
Right me when I'm wrong 
You can hold me when I'm scared 
You won't always be there 
So love me when I'm gone 
Love me when I'm gone 
 
Or maybe I'm just blind 
 
So hold me when I'm here 
Right me when I'm wrong 
Hold me when I'm scared 
And love me when I'm gone 
Everything I am and everything in me 
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be 
I'd never let you down 
Even if I could 
I'd give up everything 
If only for your good 
So hold me when I'm here 
Right me when I'm wrong 
You can hold me when I'm scared 
You won't always be there 
So love me when I'm gone 
Love me when I'm gone 
Love me when I'm gone 
 
Love me when I'm gone 
When I'm gone 
When I'm gone 
When I'm gone


All day staring at the ceiling 
Making friends with shadows on my wall 
All night hearing voices telling me 
That I should get some sleep 
Because tomorrow might be good for something 
 
Hold on 
Feeling like I'm headed for a breakdown 
And I don't know why 
 
But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell 
I know right now you can't tell 
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see 
A different side of me 
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired 
I know right now you don't care 
But soon enough you're gonna think of me 
And how I used to be...me 
 
I'm talking to myself in public 
and dodging glances on the train 
And I know, I know they've all been talking about me 
I can hear them whisper 
And it makes me think there must be something wrong with me 
Out of all the hours thinking 
Somehow I've lost my mind 
 
But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell 
I know right now you can't tell 
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see 
A different side of me 
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired 
I know right now you don't care 
But soon enough you're gonna think of me 
And how I used to be 
 
I've been talking in my sleep 
Pretty soon they'll come to get me 
Yeah, they're taking me away 
 
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell 
I know right now you can't tell 
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see 
A different side of me 
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired 
I know right now you don't care 
But soon enough you're gonna think of me 
And how I used to be 
 
Yeah, how I used to be 
How I used to be 
Well, I'm just a little unwell 
How I used to be 
How I used to be 
I'm just a little unwell

Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you 
Is your heart still mine, I wanna cry sometimes

Straight from high school, you up and left me

[Kid Rock:] 
Livin' my life in a slow hell 
Different girl every night at the hotel 
I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days 
Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whiskey 
Wish I had a good girl to miss me 
Lord, I wonder if I'll ever change my ways 
 
I put your picture away 
Sat down and cried today 
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her 
I put your picture away 
Sat down and cried today 
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her (Ooh-ooh) 
 
 [Sheryl Crow:] 
I called you last night in the hotel 
Everyone knows, but they won't tell 
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right 
I've been waitin' on you for a long time 
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine 
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights 
 
I put your picture away 
I wonder where you've been 
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him (Ooh) 
I put your picture away 
I wonder where you've been 
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him (Ooh) 
 
 [Sheryl Crow (Kid Rock) {Both}:] 
I saw you yesterday with an old friend 
(It was the same old same "How have you been?") 
{Since you've been gone, my world's been dark and grey} 
(You reminded me of brighter days) 
I hoped you were comin' home to stay 
I was headed to church 
(I was off to drink you away (Drink you away)) 
{I thought about you for a long time} 
{Can't seem to get you off my mind} 
{I can't understand why we're living life this way} 
 
 [Kid Rock & Sheryl Crow {Kid Rock}:] 
I found your picture today 
I swear I'll change my ways 
{I just} called to say I want you 
To come back home (Ooh-ooh) 
I found your picture today 
I swear I'll change my ways 
{I just} called to say I want you 
To come back home 
 
 [Kid Rock & Sheryl Crow:] 
I just called to say I love you 
Come back home


How can you see into my eyes like open doors? 
Leading you down into my core where I've become so numb 
Without a soul my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold 
Until you find it there and lead it back home 
 
(Wake me up) 
Wake me up inside 
(I can't wake up) 
Wake me up inside 
(Save me) 
Call my name and save me from the dark 
(Wake me up) 
Bid my blood to run 
(I can't wake up) 
Before I come undone 
(Save me) 
Save me from the nothing I've become 
 
Now that I know what I'm without 
You can't just leave me 
Breathe into me and make me real 
Bring me to life 
 
(Wake me up) 
Wake me up inside 
(I can't wake up) 
Wake me up inside 
(Save me) 
Call my name and save me from the dark 
(Wake me up) 
Bid my blood to run 
(I can't wake up) 
Before I come undone 
(Save me) 
Save me from the nothing I've become 
 
Bring me to life 
(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside) 
Bring me to life 
 
Frozen inside without your touch 
Without your love, darling 
Only you are the life among the dead 
 
All this time I can't believe I couldn't see 
Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me 
I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems 
Got to open my eyes to everything 
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul 
Don't let me die here 
There must be something more 
Bring me to life 
 
(Wake me up) 
Wake me up inside 
(I can't wake up) 
Wake me up inside 
(Save me) 
Call my name and save me from the dark 
(Wake me up) 
Bid my blood to run 
(I can't wake up) 
Before I come undone 
(Save me) 
Save me from the nothing I've become 
 
Bring me to life 
(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside) 
Bring me to life
