[Gotye:] 
Now and then I think of when we were together 
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die 
Told myself that you were right for me 
But felt so lonely in your company 
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember 
 
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness 
Like resignation to the end, always the end 
So when we found that we could not make sense 
Well you said that we would still be friends 
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over 
 
But you didn't have to cut me off 
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing 
And I don't even need your love 
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough 
No you didn't have to stoop so low 
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number 
I guess that I don't need that though 
Now you're just somebody that I used to know 
 
Now you're just somebody that I used to know 
Now you're just somebody that I used to know 
 
 [Kimbra:] 
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over 
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done 
But I don't wanna live that way 
Reading into every word you say 
You said that you could let it go 
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know 
 
 [Gotye:] 
But you didn't have to cut me off 
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing 
And I don't even need your love 
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough 
No you didn't have to stoop so low 
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number 
I guess that I don't need that though 
Now you're just somebody that I used to know 
 
Somebody 
(I used to know) 
Somebody 
(Now you're just somebody that I used to know) 
 
Somebody 
(I used to know) 
Somebody 
(Now you're just somebody that I used to know) 
 
(I used to know) 
(That I used to know) 
(I used to know) 
Somebody


I threw a wish in the well 
Don't ask me, I'll never tell 
I looked to you as it fell 
And now you're in my way 
 
I'd trade my soul for a wish 
Pennies and dimes for a kiss 
I wasn't looking for this 
But now you're in my way 
 
Your stare was holdin' 
Ripped jeans, skin was showin' 
Hot night, wind was blowin' 
Where you think you're going, baby? 
 
Hey, I just met you 
And this is crazy 
But here's my number 
So call me, maybe? 
 
It's hard to look right 
At you baby 
But here's my number 
So call me, maybe? 
 
Hey, I just met you 
And this is crazy 
But here's my number 
So call me, maybe? 
 
And all the other boys 
Try to chase me 
But here's my number 
So call me, maybe? 
 
You took your time with the call 
I took no time with the fall 
You gave me nothing at all 
But still, you're in my way 
 
I beg, and borrow and steal 
At first sight and it's real 
I didn't know I would feel it 
But it's in my way 
 
Your stare was holdin' 
Ripped jeans, skin was showin' 
Hot night, wind was blowin' 
Where you think you're going, baby? 
 
Hey, I just met you 
And this is crazy 
But here's my number 
So call me, maybe? 
 
It's hard to look right 
At you baby 
But here's my number 
So call me, maybe? 
 
Hey, I just met you 
And this is crazy 
But here's my number 
So call me, maybe? 
 
And all the other boys 
Try to chase me 
But here's my number 
So call me, maybe? 
 
Before you came into my life 
I missed you so bad 
I missed you so bad 
I missed you so, so bad 
 
Before you came into my life 
I missed you so bad 
And you should know that 
I missed you so, so bad 
 
It's hard to look right 
At you baby 
But here's my number 
So call me, maybe? 
 
Hey, I just met you 
And this is crazy 
But here's my number 
So call me, maybe? 
 
And all the other boys

Before you came into my life 
I missed you so bad 
I missed you so bad 
I missed you so, so bad 
 
Before you came into my life 
I missed you so bad 
And you should know that 
 
So call me, maybe?



Give me a second I 
I need to get my story straight 
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State 
My lover she's waiting for me just across the bar 
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar, and 
I know I gave it to you months ago 
I know you're trying to forget 
But between the drinks and subtle things 
The holes in my apologies, you know 
I'm trying hard to take it back 
So if by the time the bar closes 
And you feel like falling down 
I'll carry you home 
 
Tonight 
We are young 
So let's set the world on fire 
We can burn brighter than the sun 
 
Tonight 
We are young 
So let's set the world on fire 
We can burn brighter than the sun 
 
Now I know that I'm not 
All that you got 
I guess that I, I just thought 
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart 
But our friends are back 
So let's raise a toast 
'Cause I found someone to carry me home 
 
Tonight 
We are young 
So let's set the world on fire 
We can burn brighter than the sun 
 
Tonight 
We are young 
So let's set the world on fire 
We can burn brighter than the sun 
 
Carry me home tonight (Nananananana) 
Just carry me home tonight (Nananananana) 
Carry me home tonight (Nananananana) 
Just carry me home tonight (Nananananana) 
 
The moon is on my side (Nananananana) 
I have no reason to run (Nananananana) 
So will someone come and carry me home tonight (Nananananana) 
The angels never arrived (Nananananana) 
But I can hear the choir (Nananananana) 
So will someone come and carry me home (Nananananana) 
 
Tonight 
We are young 
So let's set the world on fire 
We can burn brighter than the sun 
 
Tonight 
We are young 
So let's set the world on fire 
We can burn brighter than the sun 
 
So if by the time the bar closes 
And you feel like falling down 
I'll carry you home tonight


I'm at a payphone trying to call home 
All of my change I spent on you 
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong 
Where are the plans we made for two? 
 
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember 
The people we used to be 
It's even harder to picture 
That you're not here next to me 
 
You say it's too late to make it 
But is it too late to try? 
And in our time that you wasted 
All of our bridges burned down 
 
I've wasted my nights 
You turned out the lights 
Now I'm paralyzed 
Still stuck in that time 
When we called it love 
But even the sun sets in paradise 
 
I'm at a payphone trying to call home 
All of my change I spent on you 
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong 
Where are the plans we made for two? 
 
If "Happy Ever After" did exist 
I would still be holding you like this 
 [Explicit:]  All those fairy tales are full of shit 
 [Clean:]  All those fairy tales are full of it 
 [Explicit:]  One more fucking love song, I'll be sick 
 [Clean:]  One more stupid love song, I'll be sick 
 
Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow 
'Cause you forgot yesterday 
I gave you my love to borrow 
But you just gave it away 
 
You can't expect me to be fine (Oh-oh) 
I don't expect you to care (Yeah) 
I know I've said it before 
But all of our bridges burned down 
 
I've wasted my nights 
You turned out the lights 
Now I'm paralyzed 
Still stuck in that time 
When we called it "love" 
But even the sun sets in paradise 
 
I'm at a payphone trying to call home 
All of my change I spent on you (Oh, oh-oh-oh) 
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong 
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah) 
 
If "Happy Ever After" did exist 
I would still be holding you like this 
 [Explicit:]  All those fairy tales are full of shit 
 [Clean:]  All those fairy tales are full of it 
 [Explicit:]  One more fucking love song, I'll be sick (Yeah, uh) 
 [Clean:]  One more stupid love song, I'll be sick, oh 
Now I'm at a payphone 
 
 [Clean radio-version verse:] 
Yeah, yeah, now baby don't hang up 
So I can tell you what you need to know 
Baby I'm begging you just please don't go 
So I can tell you what you need to know 
 
 [Explicit-version verse (Wiz Khalifa):] 
Man, fuck that shit 
I'll be out spending all this money 
While you're sitting 'round wondering 
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing 
Made it from the bottom 
Now when you see me I'm stunting 
And all of my cars start with a push of a button 
Telling me I changed since I blew up 
Or whatever you call it 
Switched the number to my phone 
So you never could call it 
Don't need my name on my shirt 
You can tell that I'm balling 
Swish, what a shame could have got picked 
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot 
So you talk about who you see at the top 
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for 
Phantom pulled up valet open doors 
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for 
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take 
That little piece of shit with you (Yeah) 
 
I'm at a payphone trying to call home 
All of my change I spent on you (Woo) 
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong (Yeah) 
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah) 
 
If "Happy Ever After" did exist (Oh) 
I would still be holding you like this 
 [Explicit:]  All those fairy tales are full of shit (Yeah) 
 [Clean:]  All those fairy tales are full of it 
 [Explicit:]  One more fucking love song, I'll be sick, oh 
 [Clean:]  One more stupid love song, I'll be sick, yeah 
Now I'm at a payphone


I had a way then losing it all on my own 
I had a heart then but the queen has been overthrown 
And I'm not sleeping now, the dark is too hard to beat 
And I'm not keeping now the strength I need to push me 
 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine it when I'm alone 
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong 
And dreaming when they're gone 
 
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home 
Calling, calling, calling home 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine it when I'm alone home 
 
Voices I play within my head 
Touch my own skin and hope that I'm still breathing 
And I think back to when my brother and my sister slept 
In an unknown place the only time I feel safe 
 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine it when I'm alone 
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong 
And dreaming when they're gone 
 
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home 
Calling, calling, calling home 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine it when I'm alone home 
 
Yeah, hee 
 
Light, lights, lights, lights 
Light, lights, lights, lights 
(Home, home) 
Light, lights, lights, lights 
Light, lights 
 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine it when I'm alone 
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong 
And dreaming when they're gone 
 
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home 
Calling, calling, calling home 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine it when I'm alone home 
 
Home, home 
Light, lights, lights, lights 
Light, lights, lights, lights 
 
Home, home 
Light, lights, lights, lights 
Light, lights, lights, lights 
 
Home, home 
Light, lights, lights, lights 
Light, lights, lights, lights 
 
Home, home 
Light, lights, lights, lights 
Light, lights, lights, lights


The sun goes down 
The stars come out 
And all that counts 
Is here and now 
My universe will never be the same 
I'm glad you came 
 
You cast a spell on me, spell on me 
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me 
And I decided you look well on me, well on me 
So let's go somewhere no one else can see, you and me 
 
Turn the lights out now 
Now I'll take you by the hand 
Hand you another drink 
Drink it if you can 
Can you spend a little time, 
Time is slipping away, 
Away from us so stay, 
Stay with me I can make, 
Make you glad you came 
 
The sun goes down 
The stars come out 
And all that counts 
Is here and now 
My universe will never be the same 
I'm glad you came 
I'm glad you came 
 
You cast a spell on me, spell on me 
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me 
And I decided you look well on me, well on me 
So let's go somewhere no one else can see, you and me 
 
Turn the lights out now 
Now I'll take you by the hand 
Hand you another drink 
Drink it if you can 
Can you spend a little time, 
Time is slipping away, 
Away from us so stay, 
Stay with me I can make, 
Make you glad you came 
 
The sun goes down 
The stars come out 
And all that counts 
Is here and now 
My universe will never be the same 
I'm glad you came 
I'm glad you came 
 
I'm glad you came 
So glad you came 
I'm glad you came 
I'm glad you came 
 
The sun goes down 
The stars come out 
And all that counts 
Is here and now 
My universe will never be the same 
I'm glad you came 
I'm glad you came


You know the bed feels warmer 
Sleepin' here alone (Sleepin' here alone) 
You know I dream in color 
And do the things I want (Do the things I want) 
 
You think you got the best of me 
Think you've had the last laugh 
Bet you think that everything good is gone 
Think you left me broken down 
Think that I'll come running back 
Baby, you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong 
 
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger 
Stand a little taller 
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone 
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter 
Footsteps even lighter 
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone  
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger 
Just me, myself, and I 
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger 
Stand a little taller 
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone 
 
You heard that I was starting over with someone new 
They told you I was moving on and over you 
 
You didn't think that I'd come back 
I'd come back swinging 
You tried to break me, but you see 
 
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger 
Stand a little taller 
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone 
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter 
Footsteps even lighter 
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone  
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger 
Just me, myself, and I 
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger 
Stand a little taller 
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone 
 
Thanks to you, I got a new thing started 
Thanks to you, I'm not the broken-hearted 
Thanks to you I'm finally thinkin' 'bout me 
You know in the end, the day you left was just my beginning 
In the end 
 
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger 
Stand a little taller 
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone 
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter 
Footsteps even lighter 
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone  
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger 
Just me, myself, and I 
 
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger 
Stand a little taller 
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone (What doesn't kill you) 
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger 
Just me, myself, and I (What doesn't kill you) 
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger (Stronger) 
Stand a little taller (Taller) 
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone (What doesn't kill you) 
 
When I'm alone


Yellow diamonds in the light 
And we're standing side by side 
As your shadow crosses mine 
What it takes to come alive 
 
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny 
But I've gotta let it go 
 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
 
Shine a light through an open door 
Love and life I will divide 
Turn away 'cause I need you more 
Feel the heartbeat in my mind 
 
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny 
But I've gotta let it go 
 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
 
Yellow diamonds in the light 
And we're standing side by side 
As your shadow crosses mine (mine, mine, mine) 
 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place

[Liam:] 
You're insecure 
Don't know what for 
You're turning heads when you walk through the door 
Don't need make-up 
To cover up 
Being the way that you are is enough 
 
 [Harry:] 
Everyone else in the room can see it 
Everyone else but you 
 
 [All:] 
Baby you light up my world like nobody else 
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed 
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell 
You don't know 
Oh, oh 
You don't know you're beautiful 
If only you saw what I can see 
You'd understand why I want you so desperately 
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe 
You don't know 
Oh, oh 
You don't know you're beautiful 
Oh, oh 
That's what makes you beautiful 
 
 [Zayn:] 
So c-come on 
You got it wrong 
To prove I'm right 
I put it in a song 
I don't know why 
You're being shy 
And turn away when I look into your eye-eye-eyes 
 
 [Harry] 
Everyone else in the room can see it 
Everyone else but you 
 
 [All:] 
Baby you light up my world like nobody else 
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed 
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell 
You don't know 
Oh oh 
You don't know you're beautiful 
If only you saw what I can see 
You'll understand why I want you so desperately 
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe 
You don't know 
Oh oh 
You don't know you're beautiful 
Oh oh 
 
 [Harry:] 
That's what makes you beautiful 
 
Nana nana nana nana 
Nana nana nana nana 
Nana nana nana nana 
 
 [Harry:] 
Baby you light up my world like nobody else 
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed 
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
