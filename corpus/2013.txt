Hey, Macklemore! Can we go thrift shopping?

This is fucking awesome 
 
Nah, walk into the club like, "What up? I got a big cock!" 
I'm so pumped about some shit from the thrift shop 
Ice on the fringe, it's so damn frosty 
The people like, "Damn! That's a cold ass honkey." 
Rollin' in, hella deep, headed to the mezzanine, 
Dressed in all pink, 'cept my gator shoes, those are green 
Draped in a leopard mink, girls standin' next to me 
Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets 
Piss 
But shit! It was ninety-nine cents! Bag it 
Coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments 
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else's been walkin' in 
Bummy and grungy, fuck it, man 
I am stuntin' and flossin' and 
Savin' my money and I'm hella happy that's a bargain, bitch 
I'm a take your grandpa's style, I'm a take your grandpa's style, 
No, for real. Ask your grandpa. Can I have his hand-me-downs? Thank you 
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers 
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin' 
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard 
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a kneeboard 
Hello, hello, my ace man, my Mello 
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no 
I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those 
The sneaker heads would be like "Aw, he got the Velcros" 
 
 [2x] 
I'm gonna pop some tags 
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket 
I - I - I'm hunting, looking for a come-up 
This is fucking awesome 
 
What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin? 
What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin? 
I'm digging, I'm digging, I'm searching right through that luggage 
One man's trash, that's another man's come-up 
Thank your granddad for donating that plaid button-up shirt 
'Cause right now I'm up in her skirt

The built-in onesie with the socks on that motherfucker 
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker 
They be like, "Oh, that Gucci. That's hella tight." 
I'm like, "Yo, that's fifty dollars for a T-shirt." 
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition 
Fifty dollars for a T-shirt - that's just some ignorant bitch. Shit 
I call that getting swindled and pimped. Shit

Whoa, oh, oh 
Whoa, oh, oh 
Whoa, oh, oh 
Whoa 
 
I'm waking up to ash and dust 
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust 
I'm breathing in the chemicals 
 [Inhale, exhale] 
 
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus 
This is it, the apocalypse 
Whoa oh 
 
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones 
Enough to make my system blow 
Welcome to the new age, to the new age 
Welcome to the new age, to the new age 
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive 
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive 
 
I raise my flag and dye my clothes 
It's a revolution, I suppose 
We're painted red to fit right in 
Whoa oh 
 
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus 
This is it, the apocalypse 
Whoa oh

Deep in my bones, straight from inside

Welcome to the new age, to the new age 
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Ay, ay, ay 
Good to see you, come on in, let's go 
Yeah, let's go 
Ha-ha-ha-ha 
Alright, alright 
OK, uh, alright, OK 
Alright, OK 
 
Return of the Mack, get up! 
What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't 
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed 
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking on who hit me 
 
Get up! Thrift shop, pimp-strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious 
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby. Sweater game, nope, nope y'all can't copy 
 
Yup. Bad, moon-walking, this here is our party, my posse's been on Broadway 
And we did it our way 
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it 
And yet I'm on 
 
Let that stage light go and shine on down 
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style 
 
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds 
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town 
 
Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustling 
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen with the four-track bussing 
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crush shit 
 
Labels out here 
Nah, they can't tell me nothing (Hey, hey, hey) 
We give that to the people 
Spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey) 
Labels out here 
Nah, they can't tell me nothing (Hey, hey, hey) 
We give it to the people 
Spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey) 
 
Can we go back? This is the moment 
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over 
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us 
Like the ceiling can't hold us 
 
Can we go back? This is the moment 
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over 
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us 
Like the ceiling can't hold us 
 
Nah, can I kick it? Thank you. Yeah I'm so damn grateful 
I grew up, really wanted gold fronts 
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you 
 
Y'all can't stop me, go hard like I got a 808 in my heart beat 
And I'm eating at the beat like you give a little speed to a great white shark on Shark Week 
 
Raw. Time to go off. I'm gone 
Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome 
Caesar'll make you a believer 
 
Nah I never ever did it for a throne 
That validation comes from giving it back to the people 
Nah sing this song and it goes like 
 
"Raise those hands, this is our party 
We came here to live life like nobody was watching" 
I got my city right behind me 
If I fall, they got me 
Learn from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching. I said 
 
Can we go back? This is the moment 
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over 
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us 
Like the ceiling can't hold us 
 
Can we go back? This is the moment 
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over 
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us 
Like the ceiling can't hold us 
 
And so we put our hands up 
And so we put our hands up 
 
Wa oh oh oh wa oh oh oh wa oh oh 
Let's go! 
 
Na na na na na na na na (aha) 
Hey 
And all my people say 
 
Na na na na na na na na (that's right, feels good) 
Hey 
And all my people say 
 
Na na na na na na na na (it's alright) 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) 
And all my people say 
 
Na na na na na na na na 
Mack-le-le-le-le-le-more 
 
 [Album version ending:] 
Can we go back? This is the moment 
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over 
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us 
Like the ceiling can't hold us 
Can we go back? This is the moment 
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over 
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us 
Like the ceiling can't hold us


Aren't you somethin' to admire? 
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror 
And I can't help but notice 
You reflect in this heart of mine 
If you ever feel alone and 
The glare makes me hard to find 
Just know that I'm always parallel on the other side 
 
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul 
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go 
Just put your hand on the glass 
I'm here tryin' to pull you through 
You just gotta be strong 
 
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me 
The vacancy that sat in my heart 
Is a space that now you hold 
Show me how to fight for now 
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy 
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out 
You were right here all along 
 
It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside of me 
And now it's clear as this promise 
That we're making two reflections into one 
'Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me 
 
Aren't you somethin', an original 
'Cause it doesn't seem merely a sample 
And I can't help but stare, 'cause 
I see truth somewhere in your eyes 
I can't ever change without you 
You reflect me, I love that about you 
And if I could, I would look at us all the time 
 
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul 
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go 
Just put your hand on the glass 
I'm here tryin' to pull you through 
You just gotta be strong 
 
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me 
The vacancy that sat in my heart 
Is a space that now you hold 
Show me how to fight for now 
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy 
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out 
You were right here all along 
 
It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside of me 
And now it's clear as this promise 
That we're making two reflections into one 
'Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me 
 
Yesterday is history 
Tomorrow's a mystery 
I can see you lookin' back at me 
Keep your eyes on me 
Baby, keep your eyes on me 
 
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me 
The vacancy that sat in my heart 
Is a space that now you hold 
Show me how to fight for now (please show me, baby) 
I'll tell you, baby, it was easy 
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out 
You were right here all along 
 
It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside of me 
And now it's clear as this promise 
That we're making two reflections into one 
'Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me 
 
You are, you are the love of my life  [10x] 
 
Now you're the inspiration of this precious song 
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on 
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone 
And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home 
Just to let you know, you are 
 
You are, you are the love of my life  [8x] 
 
Girl you're my reflection, all I see is you 
My reflection, in everything I do 
You're my reflection and all I see is you 
My reflection, in everything I do 
 
You are, you are the love of my life  [16x]


Right from the start 
You were a thief 
You stole my heart 
And I your willing victim 
I let you see the parts of me 
That weren't all that pretty 
And with every touch you fixed them 
 
Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh, oh 
Things you never say to me, oh, oh 
Tell me that you've had enough 
Of our love, our love 
 
Just give me a reason 
Just a little bit's enough 
Just a second we're not broken just bent 
And we can learn to love again 
It's in the stars 
It's been written in the scars on our hearts 
We're not broken just bent 
And we can learn to love again 
 
I'm sorry I don't understand 
Where all of this is coming from 
I thought that we were fine 
(Oh, we had everything) 
Your head is running wild again 
My dear we still have everythin' 
And it's all in your mind 
(Yeah, but this is happenin') 
 
You've been havin' real bad dreams, oh, oh 
You used to lie so close to me, oh, oh 
There's nothing more than empty sheets 
Between our love, our love 
Oh, our love, our love, love 
 
Just give me a reason 
Just a little bit's enough 
Just a second we're not broken just bent 
And we can learn to love again 
I never stopped 
You're still written in the scars on my heart 
You're not broken just bent 
And we can learn to love again 
 
Oh, tear ducts and rust 
I'll fix it for us 
We're collecting dust 
But our love's enough 
You're holding it in 
You're pouring a drink 
No nothing is as bad as it seems 
We'll come clean 
 
Just give me a reason 
Just a little bit's enough 
Just a second we're not broken just bent 
And we can learn to love again 
It's in the stars 
It's been written in the scars on our hearts 
That we're not broken just bent 
And we can learn to love again 
 
Just give me a reason 
Just a little bit's enough 
Just a second we're not broken just bent 
And we can learn to love again 
It's in the stars 
It's still written in the scars on our hearts 
That we're not broken just bent 
And we can learn to love again 
 
Oh-oh, we can learn to love again 
Oh-oh, can learn to love again 
Oh, oh, that we're not broken just bent 
And we can learn to love again


Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now 
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same 
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down 
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name 
 
It all just sounds like ooooohâ¦ 
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize 
That I should've bought you flowers 
And held your hand 
Should've gave you all my hours 
When I had the chance 
Take you to every party 
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance 
Now my baby's dancing 
But she's dancing with another man 
 
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways 
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life 
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, ohhâ¦ 
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes 
 
It all just sounds like ooooohâ¦ 
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize 
That I should've bought you flowers 
And held your hand 
Should've gave you all my hours 
When I had the chance 
Take you to every party 
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance 
Now my baby's dancing 
But she's dancing with another man 
 
Although it hurts 
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong 
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late 
To try and apologize for my mistakes 
But I just want you to know 
 
I hope he buys you flowers 
I hope he holds your hand 
Give you all his hours 
When he has the chance 
Take you to every party 
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance 
Do all the things I should have done 
When I was your man 
Do all the things I should have done 
When I was your man


Baby you a song 
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise 
 
Hey baby 
 
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her 
Sheâs poppinâ right out of the South Georgia water 
Thought, "Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs!" 
Couldnât help myself so I walked up and said 
 
Baby you a song 
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise 
Down a back road blowinâ stop signs through the middle 
Every little farm town with you 
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit 
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it 
So baby you a song 
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise 
 
She was sippinâ on Southern and singinâ Marshall Tucker 
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer 
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said, 
"Fire it up, letâs go get this thing stuck." 
 
Baby you a song 
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise 
Down a back road blowinâ stop signs through the middle 
Every little farm town with you 
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit 
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it 
So baby you a song 
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise 
 
When that summer sun fell to its knees 
I looked at her and she looked at me 
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night 
'Cause it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right 
 
I put it in park and 
Grabbed my guitar 
And strummed a couple chords 
And sang from the heart 
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpinâ 
Hell, I canât get you out of my head 
 
Baby you a song 
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise 
Down a back road blowinâ stop signs through the middle 
Every little farm town with you 
 
Baby you a song 
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise 
Down a back road blowinâ stop signs through the middle 
Every little farm town with you 
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit 
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it 
Come on 
 
Baby you a song 
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise 
 
Come on, girl 
Get those windows down and cruise 
Aww, yeah.


I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath 
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess 
So I sat quietly 
Agreed politely 
 
I guess that I forgot I had a choice 
I let you push me past the breaking point 
I stood for nothing 
So I fell for everything 
 
You held me down, but I got up (Hey!) 
Already brushing off the dust 
You hear my voice, you hear that sound 
Like thunder gonna shake the ground 
You held me down, but I got up (Hey!) 
Get ready 'cause I've had enough 
I see it all, I see it now 
 
I got the eye of the tiger 
A fighter 
Dancing through the fire 
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar 
Louder, louder than a lion 
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar 
 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
You're gonna hear me roar 
 
Now I'm floating like a butterfly 
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes 
I went from zero 
To my own hero 
 
You held me down, but I got up (Hey!) 
Already brushing off the dust 
You hear my voice, you hear that sound 
Like thunder gonna shake the ground 
You held me down, but I got up (Got up!) 
Get ready 'cause I've had enough 
I see it all, I see it now 
 
I got the eye of the tiger 
A fighter 
Dancing through the fire 
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar 
Louder, louder than a lion 
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar 
 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
You're gonna hear me roar 
 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
You'll hear me roar 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
You're gonna hear me roar 
 
Roar, roar, roar, roar, roar 
 
I got the eye of the tiger 
A fighter 
Dancing through the fire 
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar 
Louder, louder than a lion 
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar 
 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
You're gonna hear me roar 
 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
You'll hear me roar 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
You're gonna hear me roar
