Shawty had them Apple Bottom jeans (Jeans), boots with the fur (With the fur) 
The whole club was lookin' at her 
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know 
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low

 [Flo Rida:] 
Hey, I ain't never seen nothin' that'll make me go 
This crazy all night spendin' my dough 
Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go 
Them birthday cakes they stole the show 
So sexual, she was flexible  
Professional, drinkin' X and O 
Hold up, wait a minute, do I see what I think I, whoa 
Did I think I see shawty get low? 
Ain't the same when it's up that close 
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow 
Work the pole, I got the bank roll 
I'ma say that I prefer them no clothes 
I'm into that, I love women exposed 
She threw it back at me, I gave her mo' 
Cash ain't no problem, I know where it goes 
She had them

 [Flo Rida:] 
Hey, shawty, what I gotta do to get you home? 
My jeans full of guap and they ready for shones 
Cadillacs, Maybachs for the sexy groan 
Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan 
One stack c'mon, two stacks c'mon 
Three stacks c'mon, now that's three grand 
What, you think I'm playin', baby girl? 
I'm the man, I invented rubber bands 
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder 
I knew it was over, that Henny and Cola 
Got me like a soldier, she ready for Rover 
I couldn't control her 
So lucky oh me, I was just like a clover 
Shawty was hot like a toaster 
Sorry but I had to fold her 
Like a pornography poster, she showed her 
 
 [T-Pain:] 
Apple Bottom jeans (Jeans), boots with the fur (With the fur) 
The whole club was lookin' at her 
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know

 [Flo Rida:] 
Whoa, shawty 
Yeah she was worth the money 
Lil' mama took my cash 
And I ain't want it back 
The way she bent that back 
Got her them paper stacks 
Tattoo above her crack 
I had to handle that 
I was on it, sexy woman 
Let me showin' and made me want it 
Two in the mornin', I'm zonin' 
And them Rosay bottles foamin' 
She wouldn't stop, made it drop 
Shawty did that pop and lock 
Had to break her off that guap 
Gal was fly just like my Glock

Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low (Come on)



Hmm, hmm 
Hey 
 
Closed off from love 
I didn't need the pain 
Once or twice was enough 
And it was all in vain 
Time starts to pass 
Before you know it you're frozen 
Ooh 
 
But something happened 
For the very first time with you 
My heart melted to the ground 
Found something true 
And everyone's looking 'round 
Thinking I'm going crazy 
Ooh, yeah 
 
But I don't care what they say 
I'm in love with you 
They try to pull me away 
But they don't know the truth 
My heart's crippled by the vein 
That I keep on closing 
You cut me open and I 
 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
I keep bleeding 
I keep, keep bleeding love 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
You cut me open 
 
Huh, uh 
Trying hard not to hear 
But they talk so loud 
Their piercing sounds fill my ears 
Try to fill me with doubt 
Yet I know that their goal 
Is to keep me from falling, ooh, yeah 
 
But nothing's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace 
And in this world of loneliness 
I see your face 
Yet everyone around me 
Thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe 
 
But I don't care what they say 
I'm in love with you 
They try to pull me away 
But they don't know the truth 
My heart's crippled by the vein 
That I keep on closing 
You cut me open and I 
 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
I keep bleeding 
I keep, keep bleeding love 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
You cut me open 
 
Oh, oh 
And it's draining all of me 
Oh they find it hard to believe 
I'll be wearing these scars 
For everyone to see 
 
I don't care what they say 
I'm in love with you 
They try to pull me away 
But they don't know the truth 
My heart's crippled by the vein 
That I keep on closing 
You cut me open and I 
 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
I keep bleeding 
I keep, keep bleeding love (You) 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
You cut me open and I 
 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love (You) 
I keep bleeding 
I keep, keep bleeding love (Oh, keep bleeding love) 
Keep bleeding (I keep) 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
You cut me open and I 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
Hey


I just want you close 
Where you can stay forever 
You can be sure 
That it will only get better 
 
You and me together 
Through the days and nights 
I don't worry 'cause 
Everything's gonna be alright 
People keep talking they can say what they like 
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright 
 
No one, no one, no one 
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling 
No one, no one, no one 
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you 
Can get in the way of what I feel for you 
 
When the rain is pouring down 
And my heart is hurting 
You will always be around 
This I know for certain 
 
You and me together 
Through the days and nights 
I don't worry 'cause 
Everything's gonna be alright 
People keep talking they can say what they like 
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright 
 
No one, no one, no one 
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling 
No one, no one, no one 
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you 
Can get in the way of what I feel 
 
I know some people search the world 
To find something like what we have 
I know people will try, try to divide, something so real 
So till the end of time I'm telling you there ain't no one 
 
No one, no one 
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling 
No one, no one, no one 
Can get in the way of what I feel for you 
 
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh 
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh

I'm holding on your rope 
Got me ten feet off the ground 
And I'm hearing what you say 
But I just can't make a sound 
You tell me that you need me 
Then you go and cut me down 
But wait 
You tell me that you're sorry 
Didn't think I'd turn around and say 
 
That it's too late to apologize, it's too late 
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late 
 
I'd take another chance, take a fall, take a shot for you 
And I need you like a heart needs a beat 
But that's nothing new 
 
I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue 
And you say 
Sorry like an angel 
Heaven let me think was you 
But I'm afraid 
 
It's too late to apologize, it's too late 
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late 
Woahooo woah 
 
It's too late to apologize, it's too late 
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late 
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah 
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah 
 
I'm holding on your rope 
Got me ten feet off the ground

[Jordin] 
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air 
 
If I should die before I wake 
It's 'cause you took my breath away 
Losing you is like living in a world with no air 
Oh 
 
 [Chris Brown] 
I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave 
My heart won't move, it's incomplete 
Wish there was a way that I can make you understand 
 
 [Jordin] 
But how do you expect me 
to live alone with just me 
'Cause my world revolves around you 
It's so hard for me to breathe 
 
 [Chorus:] 
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air 
Can't live, can't breathe with no air 
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there 
It's no air, no air 
Got me out here in the water so deep 
Tell me how you gonna be without me 
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe 
It's no air, no air 
 
No air, air 
No air, air 
No air, air 
No air, air 
 
 [Chris Brown] 
I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew 
Right off the ground to float to you 
There's no gravity to hold me down for real 
 
 [Jordin] 
But somehow I'm still alive inside 
You took my breath, but I survived 
I don't know how, but I don't even care 
 
 [Both:] 
So how do you expect me 
to live alone with just me 
'Cause my world revolves around you 
It's so hard for me to breathe 
 
 [Chorus] 
 
No air, air 
No air, air 
No air, air 
No air, air 
No more 
It's no air, no air 
 
 [Chorus] 
 
No air, air 
No air, air 
No air, air 
No air, air 
 
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air 
Can't live, can't breathe with no air 
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there 
It's no air, no air 
 
Got me out here in the water so deep 
Tell me how you gonna be without me 
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe 
It's no air, no air 
 
No air, air 
No air, air 
No air, air 
No air


Head under water 
And they tell me to breathe easy for a while 
The breathing gets harder, even I know that 
Made room for me 
It's too soon to see 
If I'm happy in your hands 
I'm unusually hard to hold on to 
 
Blank stares at blank pages 
No easy way to say this 
You mean well, but you make this hard on me 
 
I'm not gonna write you a love song 
'Cause you asked for it 
'Cause you need one, you see 
I'm not gonna write you a love song 
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this 
If you're on your way 
I'm not gonna write you to stay 
If all you have is leaving 
I'mma need a better reason 
To write you a love song today, today 
 
I learned the hard way 
That they all say things you wanna hear 
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you and your twisted words, 
Your help just hurts 
You are not what I thought you were 
Hello to high and dry 
 
Convinced me to please you 
Made me think that I need this too 
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am 
 
I'm not gonna write you a love song 
'Cause you asked for it 
'Cause you need one, you see 
I'm not gonna write you a love song 
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this 
If you're on your way 
I'm not gonna write you to stay 
If all you have is leaving 
I'mma need a better reason 
To write you a love song today 
 
Promise me, you'll leave the light on 
To help me see with daylight my guide gone 
'Cause I believe there's a way you can love me 
Because I say 
 
I won't write you a love song 
'Cause you asked for it 
'Cause you need one, you see 
I'm not gonna write you a love song 
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this 
 
Is that why you wanted a love song? 
'Cause you asked for it 
'Cause you need one, you see 
I'm not gonna write you a love song 
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this 
If you're on your way 
I'm not gonna write you to stay 
If your heart is nowhere in it 
I don't want it for a minute 
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas 
When I believe that there's a reason 
To write you a love song today, today
