Welcome 
Welcome to The E.N.D 
Do not panic, there is nothing to fear 
Everything around you is changing 
Nothing stays the same 
This version of myself is not permanent 
Tomorrow, I will be different 
The energy never dies 
Energy cannot be destroyed, or created 
It always is, and it always will be 
This is the end, and the beginning 
Forever infinite 
Welcome

We were both young when I first saw you 
I close my eyes and the flashback starts: 
I'm standing there 
On a balcony in summer air 
 
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns 
See you make your way through the crowd 
And say, "Hello." 
Little did I know 
 
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles 
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet." 
And I was crying on the staircase 
Begging you, "Please don't go." 
And I said 
 
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone 
I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run 
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess 
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'." 
 
So, I sneak out to the garden to see you 
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew 
So, close your eyes 
Escape this town for a little while 
Oh, oh 
 
'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter 
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet." 
But you were everything to me 
I was begging you, "Please don't go!" 
And I said 
 
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone 
I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run 
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess 
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes' 
 
Romeo, save me. They're tryna tell me how to feel 
This love is difficult but it's real 
Don't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess 
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'." 
 
Oh, oh, oh 
 
I got tired of waiting 
Wondering if you were ever coming around 
My faith in you was fading 
When I met you on the outskirts of town 
And I said 
 
"Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone 
I keep waiting for you, but you never come 
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think." 
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said 
 
"Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone 
I love you, and that's all I really know 
I talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress 
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'." 
 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

Just like my mind where I'm goin' 
No women, no shorties, no nothin' but clothes 
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll

I know the storm is comin' 
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower

Hey, shorty must know I'm the man 
My money love her like a number one fan 
Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my bands 
My Benjamin Frank-a-lins 
A couple of grands, I got rubber bands 
My paper planes making her dance 
Get dirty all night, that's part of my plan 
We building castles that's made out of sand 
She's amazing, her fire blazing, hotter than cajun 
Girl won't you move a little closer? 
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage 
That body belongs on a poster 
I'm in a daze, that bottom is waving at me, like "Dammit! I know ya!" 
Doing a show like a gun out of holster 
Tell me whatever then I'll be your chauffeur ('Cause) 
 
You spin my head right 'round, right 'round

Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it 
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted 
I fell right through the cracks 
Now I'm trying to get back 
 
Before the cool done run out 
I'll be giving it my bestest 
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention 
I reckon, it's again my turn 
To win some or learn some 
 
But I won't hesitate 
No more, no more 
It cannot wait 
I'm yours 
 
Well, open up your mind and see like me 
Open up your plans and damn you're free 
And look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love 
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family 
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved 
 
So I won't hesitate 
No more, no more 
It cannot wait 
I'm sure 
There's no need to complicate 
Our time is short 
This is our fate 
I'm yours 
 
But don't you want to come on and scooch on over closer, dear 
And I will nibble your ear 
 
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror 
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer 
But my breath fogged up the glass 
And so I drew a new face and I laughed 
 
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason 
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons 
It's what we aim to do 
Our name is our virtue 
 
But I won't hesitate 
No more, no more 
It cannot wait 
I'm yours 
 
Well, open up your mind and see like me 
Open up your plans and damn you're free 
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours 
So please don't, please don't, please don't 
There's no need to complicate 
'Cause our time is short 
This oh, this oh, this is our fate 
I'm yours 
 
Oh, I'm yours 
Oh, I'm yours 
Oh, oh 
Baby, do believe I'm yours? 
You best believe, you best believe, I'm yours

If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it 
Whoa, oh, oh


In the night, I hear 'em talk 
The coldest story ever told 
Somewhere far along this road 
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless 
How could you be so heartless? 
Oh, how could you be so heartless? 
 
How could you be so 
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo? 
Just remember that you talkin' to me though 
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo 
I mean, after all the things that we been through 
I mean, after all the things we got into 
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me 
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me 
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me 
So you walk around like you don't know me 
You got a new friend, well, I got homies 
But in the end, it's still so lonely 
 
In the night, I hear 'em talk 
The coldest story ever told 
Somewhere far along this road 
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless 
How could you be so heartless? 
Oh, how could you be so heartless? 
 
How could you be so Dr. Evil? 
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know 
I decided we wasn't gon' speak so 
Why we up 3 AM on the phone? 
Why do she be so mad at me for? 
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold 
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up 
'Cause I already know how this thing go 
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me 
They say that they don't see what you see in me 
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see 
You'll never find nobody better than me 
 
In the night, I hear 'em talk (Me) 
The coldest story ever told 
Somewhere far along this road 
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless 
How could you be so heartless? 
Oh, how could you be so heartless? 
 
Talk and talk and talk and talk 
Baby, let's just knock it off 
They don't know what we been through 
They don't know 'bout me and you 
So I got somethin' new to see 
And you just gon' keep hatin' me 
And we just gon' be enemies 
I know you can't believe 
I could just leave it wrong 
And you can't make it right 
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night 
 
In the night, I hear 'em talk 
The coldest story ever told 
Somewhere far along this road 
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless 
How could you be so heartless? (How, how?) 
Oh, how could you be so heartless? 
 
On and on and on and on 
And on and, and on and on and on


I wake up every evening 
With a big smile on my face 
And it never feels out of place 
And you're still probably working 
At a nine to five pace 
I wonder how bad that tastes 
 
When you see my face 
Hope it gives you hell 
Hope it gives you hell 
When you walk my way 
Hope it gives you hell 
Hope it gives you hell 
 
Now where's your picket fence love? 
And where's that shiny car? 
And did it ever get you far? 
You never seemed so tense love 
I've never seen you fall so hard 
Do you know where you are? 
 
And truth be told I miss you 
And truth be told I'm lying 
 
When you see my face 
Hope it gives you hell 
Hope it gives you hell 
When you walk my way 
Hope it gives you hell 
Hope it gives you hell 
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well 
Then he's a fool you're just as well 
Hope it gives you hell 
Hope it gives you hell 
 
Tomorrow you'll be thinking to yourself 
Where'd it all go wrong? 
But the list goes on and on 
 
And truth be told I miss you 
And truth be told I'm lying 
 
When you see my face 
Hope it gives you hell 
Hope it gives you hell 
When you walk my way 
Hope it gives you hell 
Hope it gives you hell 
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well 
Then he's a fool, you're just as well 
Hope it gives you hell 
 
Now you'll never see 
What you've done to me 
You can take back your memories 
They're no good to me 
And here's all your lies 
You can look me in the eyes 
With the sad, sad look 
That you wear so well 
 
When you see my face 
Hope it gives you hell 
Hope it gives you hell 
When you walk my way 
Hope it gives you hell 
Hope it gives you hell 
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well 
Then he's a fool you're just as well 
Hope it gives you hell 
 
When you see my face 
Hope it gives you hell 
Hope it gives you hell 
When you walk my way 
Hope it gives you hell 
Hope it gives you hell 
When you hear this song and you sing along but you'll never tell 
Then you're the fool, I'm just as well 
Hope it gives you hell 
 
When you hear this song 
I hope that it will give you hell 
 
You can sing along 
I hope that it puts you through hell
