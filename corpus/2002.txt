Never made it as a wise man 
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing 
Tired of livin' like a blind man 
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling 
And this is how you remind me 
 
This is how you remind me of what I really am 
This is how you remind me of what I really am 
 
It's not like you to say sorry 
I was waitin' on a different story 
This time I'm mistaken 
For handing you a heart worth breakin' 
And I've been wrong, I've been down 
Been to the bottom of every bottle 
These five words in my head 
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?" 
 
Yet, yet, yet, no, no 
Yet, yet, yet, no, no 
 
It's not like you didn't know that 
I said, "I love you," and I swear I still do 
And it must have been so bad 
'Cause livin' with me must have damn near killed you 
 
And this is how you remind me of what I really am 
This is how you remind me of what I really am 
 
It's not like you to say sorry 
I was waitin' on a different story 
This time I'm mistaken 
For handing you a heart worth breakin' 
And I've been wrong, I've been down 
Been to the bottom of every bottle 
These five words in my head 
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?" 
 
Yet, yet, yet, no, no 
Yet, yet, yet, no, no 
Yet, yet, yet, no, no 
Yet, yet, yet, no, no 
 
Never made it as a wise man 
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealin' 
And this is how you remind me 
This is how you remind me 
 
This is how you remind me of what I really am 
This is how you remind me of what I really am 
 
It's not like you to say sorry 
I was waitin' on a different story 
This time I'm mistaken 
For handing you a heart worth breakin' 
And I've been wrong, I've been down 
Been to the bottom of every bottle 
These five words in my head 
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?" 
 
Yet, yet, are we havin' fun yet? 
Yet, yet, are we havin' fun yet? 
Yeah, yeah (These five words in my head scream) 
Are we havin' fun yet? 
Yeah, yeah (These five words in my head) 
No, no

All the things that we accept 
Be the things that we regret 
To all of my ladies (Ladies) 
Feel me, come on, sing with me 
 
See, when I get the strength to leave 
You always tell me that you need me 
And I'm weak 'cause I believe you 
And I'm mad because I love you 
So I stop and think that maybe 
You can learn to appreciate me 
Then it all remains the same 
That you ain't never gonna change 
(Never gonna change, never gonna change) 
 
See, my days are cold without you (My days are cold, baby) 
But I'm hurting while I'm with you 
And though my heart can't take no more (No more, no more) 
I keep on running back to you 
See, my days are cold without you (Without you) 
But I'm hurting while I'm with you 
And though my heart can't take no more (No more, no more) 
I keep on running back to you 
 
Baby, why you hurt me, leave me and desert me? 
Boy, I gave you all my heart and all you did was tear it up 
Looking out my window, knowing that I should go 
Even when I pack my bags, this something always holds me back

So lately, been wondering 
Who will be there to take my place 
When I'm gone, you'll need love 
To light the shadows on your face 
 
If a great wave shall fall 
It'd fall upon us all 
And between the sand and stone 
Could you make it on your own? 
 
If I could, then I would 
I'll go wherever you will go 
Way up high or down low 
I'll go wherever you will go 
 
And maybe, I'll find out 
The way to make it back someday 
To watch you, to guide you 
Through the darkest of your days 
 
If a great wave shall fall 
It'd fall upon us all 
Well, then I hope there's someone out there 
Who can bring me back to you 
 
If I could, then I would 
I'll go wherever you will go 
Way up high or down low 
I'll go wherever you will go 
 
Run away with my heart 
Run away with my hope 
Run away with my love 
 
I know now, just quite how 
My life and love might still go on 
In your heart, in your mind 
I'll stay with you for all of time 
 
If I could, then I would 
I'll go wherever you will go 
Way up high or down low 
I'll go wherever you will go 
 
If I could turn back time 
I'll go wherever you will go 
If I could make you mine 
I'll go wherever you will go 
 
I'll go wherever you will go


Making my way downtown 
Walking fast 
Faces pass 
And I'm home-bound 
 
Staring blankly ahead 
Just making my way 
Making a way 
Through the crowd 
 
And I need you 
And I miss you 
And now I wonder 
 
If I could fall into the sky 
Do you think time would pass me by? 
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles 
If I could just see you tonight 
 
It's always times like these 
When I think of you 
And I wonder if you ever think of me 
'Cause everything's so wrong 
And I don't belong 
Living in your precious memory 
 
'Cause I need you 
And I miss you 
And now I wonder 
 
If I could fall into the sky 
Do you think time would pass me by? 
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles 
If I could just see you tonight 
 
And I, I don't wanna let you know 
I, I drown in your memory 
I, I don't wanna let this go 
I, I don't 
 
Making my way downtown 
Walking fast 
Faces pass 
And I'm home-bound 
 
Staring blankly ahead 
Just making my way 
Making a way 
Through the crowd 
 
And I still need you 
And I still miss you 
And now I wonder 
 
If I could fall into the sky 
Do you think time would pass us by? 
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles 
If I could just see you 
 
If I could fall into the sky 
Do you think time would pass me by? 
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles 
If I could just see you 
If I could just hold you tonight


[Chester Bennington:] 
It starts with one 
 [Mike Shinoda:] 
One thing I don't know why 
It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme 
To explain in due time 
 
 [Chester Bennington:] 
All I know 
 [Mike Shinoda:] 
Time is a valuable thing 
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings 
Watch it count down to the end of the day 
The clock ticks life away 
 
 [Chester Bennington:] 
It's so unreal 
 [Mike Shinoda:] 
It's so unreal, didn't look out below 
Watch the time go right out the window 
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know 
I wasted it all just to watch you go 
 
 [Chester Bennington:] 
Watch you go 
 [Mike Shinoda:] 
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart 
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard 
 
 [Chester Bennington:] 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
 
 [Mike Shinoda:] 
One thing, I don't know why 
It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme 
To remind myself how I tried so hard 
 
 [Chester Bennington:] 
I tried so hard 
 [Mike Shinoda:] 
In spite of the way you were mocking me 
Acting like I was part of your property 
Remembering all the times you fought with me 
I'm surprised it got so far 
 
 [Chester Bennington:] 
Got so far 
 [Mike Shinoda:] 
Things aren't the way they were before 
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore 
Not that you knew me back then 
But it all comes back to me in the end 
 
 [Chester Bennington:] 
In the end 
 [Mike Shinoda:] 
You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart 
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard 
 
 [Chester Bennington:] 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
 
I've put my trust in you 
Pushed as far as I can go 
For all this 
There's only one thing you should know 
 
I've put my trust in you 
Pushed as far as I can go 
For all this 
There's only one thing you should know 
 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter

 [Chorus 2 Times]


Ooh-oh 
No, no, no, no 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no 
No-ooh 
 
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who 
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew 
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know 
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go 
 
I've been there, done it, fucked around 
After all that, this is what I found 
Nobody wants to be alone 
If you're touched by the words in this song 
Then maybe 
 
You got it, you got it bad 
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back 
You got it, you got it bad 
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track 
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house 
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about 
You got it bad when you're out with someone 
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else 
You got it bad 
 
When you say that you love them and you really know 
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more 
Like my money, all my cars (you can have it all and) 
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just 'cause I'm) 
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl 
I want you to know I really adore you 
All my people who know what's going on 
Look at your mate, help me sing my song 
Tell her "I'm your man, you're my girl 
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world" 
Ladies say, "I'm your girl, you're my man 
Promise to love you the best I can" 
 
See, I've been there, done it, fucked around 
After all that, this is what I found 
Everyone of y'all are just like me 
It's too bad that you can't see 
That you got it bad 
 
You got it, you got it bad 
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back 
You got it, you got it bad 
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track 
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house 
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about 
You got it bad when you're out with someone 
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else 
You got it bad 
 
You got it, you got it bad 
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back 
You got it, you got it bad 
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track 
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house 
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about 
You got it bad when you're out with someone 
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else


Everything's so blurry 
And everyone's so fake 
And everybody's empty 
And everything is so messed up 
Preoccupied without you 
I cannot live at all 
My whole world surrounds you 
I stumble then I crawl 
 
You could be my someone 
You could be my scene 
You know that I'll protect you 
From all of the obscene 
I wonder what you're doing 
Imagine where you are 
There's oceans in between us 
But that's not very far 
 
Can you take it all away? 
Can you take it all away? 
Well you shoved it in my face 
This pain you gave to me 
Can you take it all away? 
Can you take it all away? 
Well you shoved it in my face 
 
Everyone is changing 
There's no one left that's real 
So make up your own ending 
And let me know just how you feel 
Cause I am lost without you 
I cannot live at all 
My whole world surrounds you 
I stumble then I crawl 
 
And you could be my someone 
You could be my scene 
You know that I will save you 
From all of the unclean 
I wonder what you're doing 
I wonder where you are 
There's oceans in between us 
But that's not very far 
 
Can you take it all away? 
Can you take it all away? 
Well you shoved it in my face 
This pain you gave to me 
Can you take it all away? 
Can you take it all away? 
Well you shoved it in my face 
This pain you gave to me 
 
Nobody told me what you thought 
Nobody told me what to say 
Everyone showed you where to turn 
Told you when to run away 
Nobody told you where to hide 
Nobody told you what to say 
Everyone showed you where to turn 
Showed you when to run away 
 
Can you take it all away? 
Can you take it all away? 
Well you shoved it in my face 
This pain you gave to me 
Can you take it all away? 
Can you take it all away? 
Well you shoved it in my face 
This pain you gave to me 
 
This pain you gave to me 
This pain you gave to me 
 
You take it all 
You take it all away... 
This pain you gave to me 
You take it all away 
This pain you gave to me 
Take it all away 
This pain you gave to me
